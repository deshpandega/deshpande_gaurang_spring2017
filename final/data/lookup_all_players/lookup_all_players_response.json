Ramsey mainly plays as a box-to-box midfielder, but has also been deployed on the left and right wings. He played as a schoolboy for Cardiff City, where he spent eight years in youth football, became the club's youngest ever first team player, and made 22 appearances for the senior team \u2013 including the 2008 FA Cup Final.\r\n\r\nRamsey moved to Arsenal in 2008 in a \u00a35 million deal, where he quickly gained first team experience. However, his career stalled significantly after he suffered a broken leg in a match against Stoke City in February 2010. After two loan spells away from Arsenal, he returned to full fitness and re-established himself as a regular starter during the 2011\u201312 season. Ramsey was a key player for Arsenal in the 2013\u201314 season campaign, scoring 16 goals in all competitions, including the winner in the 2014 FA Cup Final.",

Scoring twice in his first three games for the club, Oxlade-Chamberlain became the youngest English goal scorer in UEFA Champions League history and has also claimed a regular place in the England Under-21s team. Fans have nicknamed Oxlade-Chamberlain \"The Ox\", derived from the first part of his surname, as well as his physical tenacity and powerful playing style.\r\n\r\nOxlade-Chamberlain made his debut for the senior England side on 26 May 2012 in a 1\u20130 win against Norway in a friendly. Following this, he received a surprise call-up to the England squad for UEFA Euro 2012, becoming the second youngest player ever to represent England in the European Championships behind Wayne Rooney.\r\n\r\nOxlade-Chamberlain joined the Southampton Academy at the age of seven and made his professional debut in 2010. On 2 March 2010, he made his first team debut for Southampton, at 16 years 199 days, coming off the bench in a 5\u20130 victory over Huddersfield Town and became the club's second youngest ever appearance maker behind Theo Walcott. Oxlade-Chamberlain appeared as an 82nd-minute substitute for Jason Puncheon on 8 May 2010 in the final game of the season against Southend United. At the beginning of the 2010\u201311 season, Oxlade-Chamberlain made his first competitive start on 10 August against Bournemouth in the first round of the League Cup. During the match he scored the second goal of Southampton's 2\u20130 victory, his first senior goal.\r\n\r\nOn 20 August 2010, shortly after his 17th birthday, Oxlade-Chamberlain signed his first professional contract lasting for three years. His first league start came in a 2\u20130 loss at home to Rochdale on 4 September 2010. His first league goal came in a 2\u20131 victory over Oldham on 23 October 2010, which proved to be the match winner, and he scored two more goals and also got an assist in a 4\u20130 win over Dagenham & Redbridge on 2 November 2010, when he was voted Man of the Match in a league game for the first time.\r\n\r\nOxlade-Chamberlain finished the season with 9 goals as Southampton were promoted, and was named in the PFA League One Team of the Year for the 2010\u201311 season. He was subsequently the subject of transfer speculation and in June his father, Mark Chamberlain, stated he was eager for his son to join Arsenal \"as soon as possible\" to \"continue his development\".\r\n\r\nOn 8 August 2011 it was announced that Oxlade-Chamberlain had signed for Premier League club Arsenal. Although neither club involved revealed details of the contractual arrangements, press sources indicated that the fee was a \u00a312 million initial payment which could rise to \u00a315 million with \"add-ons\".\r\n\r\nOn 28 August 2011, he made his Arsenal debut in the 8\u20132 defeat away to Manchester United, as a 62nd-minute substitute for Francis Coquelin, thus becoming the 150th player to represent Arsenal in the Premier League. On 20 September 2011, Oxlade-Chamberlain scored his first goal for Arsenal in the 58th minute of a League Cup match against Shrewsbury Town, with a drive from 25 yards. Arsenal won 3\u20131.\r\n\r\nOn 28 September 2011, Oxlade-Chamberlain scored the opening goal in the eighth minute of his Champions League debut against Greek side Olympiacos, running diagonally onto an Alex Song long pass and past several defenders before finishing into the corner of the goal. In doing so, he became the youngest Englishman to score in the Champions League, taking over from teammate Theo Walcott.\r\n\r\nOxlade-Chamberlain started his first Premier League match for Arsenal in a 2\u20131 defeat to Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium on 22 January 2012, contributing an assist to a Robin van Persie goal. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger replaced him with Andrei Arshavin in the 78th minute, with the score at 1\u20131. Not only did Arsenal fans boo the decision to take Chamberlain off, Van Persie also remonstrated with the manager. On 4 February 2012, Oxlade-Chamberlain celebrated his first two Premier League goals in a home game against Blackburn Rovers which finished in a 7\u20131 victory to Arsenal. Following this match, Wenger praised Oxlade-Chamberlain for his fast development.\r\n\r\nAfter the second leg of the Champions League second round against A.C. Milan, Oxlade-Chamberlain earned many plaudits for his impressive run of form, and for his display against strong European opposition; he was described by Marco van Basten as a 'gem', whilst then Arsenal captain Robin van Persie stated Oxlade-Chamberlain was the future of Arsenal and England.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his first season in the Premier League, Oxlade-Chamberlain was nominated for PFA Young Player of the Year; he was the youngest player on the shortlist and he eventually lost out to Tottenham Hotspur's Kyle Walker,",

Jenkinson began his career with Charlton Athletic before joining Arsenal in 2011. He represented both the English and Finnish national teams at youth level before making his debut for the England national team in 2012.\r\nJenkinson joined Conference South side Welling United on loan in January 2010, before starting a three-month loan with Conference Premier side Eastbourne Borough in November 2010. However, he was recalled by Charlton after a month. He made his first appearance for Charlton Athletic in the Football League Trophy Southern Section semi-final clash with Brentford at Griffin Park in December 2010, playing the whole match in the right-back position.\r\nJenkinson signed for Arsenal in June 2011, for an undisclosed fee thought to be around \u00a31 million.\r\n\r\nOn 16 August 2011, Jenkinson made his Arsenal competitive debut in the final qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League against Udinese, coming on as a second-half substitute, replacing the injured Johan Djourou early in the second half. Jenkinson made his Premier League debut against Liverpool on 20 August 2011, starting at right-back. He kept his place in the team, playing in the second leg against Udinese and then at Old Trafford against Manchester United in the Premier League, although he was sent off later in the game for a foul on Javier Hern\u00e1ndez. He also assisted Robin van Persie to score Arsenal's second in the game in an 8\u20132 loss against Manchester United. Jenkinson continued a string of appearances for Arsenal in Bacary Sagna's absence with an impressive performance against West Bromwich. Jenkinson suffered a stress fracture in his lower back which kept him out for 3 months. He made his return for the reserve team against Norwich City, playing 45 minutes. He continued his return to football coming on as a substitute against Tottenham Hotspur in the North London Derby, a game which he watched from the stands the previous year.\r\nDue to an injury to first choice right back, Bacary Sagna, Jenkinson started the first five matches of the 2012\u201313 season, and earned plaudits for his performance against Manchester City, among others.\r\nOn 19 December 2012, it was announced that Jenkinson, along with teammates Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Kieran Gibbs, Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere, signed a new long term contract with Arsenal.",

Coquelin spent three years at the club before being spotted by renowned Arsenal scout Gilles Grimandi, while on international duty, playing in a 2008 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship elite round qualification match against Israel.\r\n\r\nOn 22 July 2008, Coquelin joined Arsenal from Stade Lavallois following a successful trial with the club. Although he suffered a thigh injury which cut the trial short, Coquelin impressed and was subsequently offered a deal to stay in North London.\r\n\r\nCoquelin played for the first team in Arsenal's pre-season matches against Barnet and Szombathelyi Halad\u00e1s in the summer of 2008, and made his competitive first team debut for Arsenal in a 6\u20130 win over Sheffield United on 23 September 2008, coming on as a substitute for Fran M\u00e9rida to play at right back. Coquelin scored his first goal in an Arsenal shirt in a reserve match against Stoke City on 6 October 2008, shooting powerfully in from the edge of the box with his weaker left foot.\r\n\r\nHe was a regular for Arsenal's reserves during the 2009\u201310 season, playing 12 times and scoring twice. On 22 September 2009, he made his first start for the first team against West Bromwich Albion in the League Cup third round, playing 58 minutes before he was replaced by Mark Randall. He featured again in the League Cup, this time as a second-half substitute for Fran M\u00e9rida in the 2\u20131 victory against Liverpool. Coquelin made a disappointing first FA Cup start in a 3\u20131 loss to Stoke City. Playing in an unfamiliar right back position, he was substituted in the second half for Aaron Ramsey.",

Swiss national manager Ottmar Hitzfeld once dubbed him the \"young Schweinsteiger\", while former Arsenal defender Johan Djourou has praised his tackling, versatility, and physicality.\r\n\r\nXhaka began his career at hometown club Basel, winning the Swiss Super League in both of his seasons. He then moved to Bundesliga team Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach in 2012, playing 140 official games and scoring nine goals.\r\n\r\nHe has been a full international for Switzerland since 2011, gaining more than 40 caps. He was included in their squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016.\r\n\r\nXhaka was born in Basel, Switzerland to Kosovo Albanian parents and is the younger brother of Taulant Xhaka, who is also a professional footballer and plays for the Albania national football team and played against Granit in the second Euro 2016 match. Their family moved from Kosovo to Switzerland shortly before their children were born.\r\n\r\nThe brothers started their youth football by Concordia Basel and both moved to Basel in 2002. Xhaka played for various Basel youth teams and since 2008 has been a member of the U-21 squad. Between 2008 and 2010 he played 37 games for the U-21 team, scoring eleven goals.\r\n\r\nBefore making his international debut for Switzerland, Xhaka was still undecided whether to play for his birth country or Albania, and he complained to the Albanian sports media that FSHF was ignoring him while the Swiss Football Association was showing much more interest.\r\n\r\nXhaka debuted for Switzerland at Wembley Stadium against England, in a 2\u20132 UEFA Euro 2012 qualification draw on 4 June 2011. On 15 November of the same year, during his sixth international appearance, he scored his first international goal in the 1\u20130 away win against Luxembourg in Stade Josy Barthel.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland also tried to select him to participate in the 2012 Olympic Football tournament, but he opted to stay at his new club for pre-season training. Xhaka participated in all ten of Switzerland's 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign matches, scoring both goals in a 2\u20130 defeat of Slovenia.\r\n\r\nOn 2 June 2014, Xhaka was named in Switzerland's 2014 FIFA World Cup squad by national coach Ottmar Hitzfeld. In the team's second match, Xhaka scored in a 5\u20132 loss to France.\r\n\r\nXhaka was selected for UEFA Euro 2016, where Switzerland's campaign opened against Albania in Lens. Xhaka, whose team won 1\u20130, was playing against his own brother while their mother watched from the crowd in a t-shirt blending the two nations' flags. He was voted the man of the match. Xhaka played every minute of Switzerland's campaign, which ended in the last 16 with a loss to Poland at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard; after a 1\u20131 draw he was the only player to not score in the penalty shootout, shooting wide.",

He also played for the German national team but retired in August 2014 after winning the World Cup. Mertesacker is a youth product of Hannover 96 and he made his senior league debut in November 2003. Mertesacker was soon dubbed \"the Defence Pole\" (die Abwehrlatte) by German tabloids and gained a reputation for his good disciplinary record and went 31 Bundesliga games without being booked. Since joining Arsenal, their fans have nicknamed him the BFG, which is short for \"Big Fucking German\" and an allusion to Roald Dahl's The BFG due to his height. He has been described as an imposing, reliable, dominant and an accomplished defender.\r\n\r\nWith Werder Bremen, Mertesacker has won a DFB-Pokal title and finished runner-up in the 2008\u201309 UEFA Cup. With his quiet but effective game, he established himself as Germany's first choice centre-back. Prior to playing at senior level, he played at under-20 and under-21 level. In September 2004, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, then-manager of Germany, called Mertesacker up to the 9 October 2004 game against Iran.\r\n\r\nHe made his debut less than two weeks after his twentieth birthday when he came on as a second-half substitute for Christian W\u00f6rns. Over the course of his final two seasons at Werder Bremen, the defender received just one yellow card in 63 league matches. He has participated in the 2006, 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups and the UEFA Euros in 2008 and 2012. In 2006, the defender established the \"Per Mertesacker Stiftung\", a charitable foundation that helps support amateur sportsmen and the poor.",

After a reasonably successful season for the Italian side, he joined Reading in 2005, and, following loan spells at Maidenhead United, Northwood and Carshalton Athletic, turned fully professional in 2006. A brief loan spell to Bristol City followed, before Federici made his Reading debut during the 2006\u201307 season. However, he was still unable to dislodge Marcus Hahnemann from the starting position, and remained second choice, even going on loan to Southend United in 2008. However, after this loan spell, an injury to Hahnemann gave Federici a prolonged run in the team, and he remained first choice for several seasons.",

He is a defender who is economical with possession.\r\n\r\nSmith is a product of the Tottenham Hotspur youth academy.\r\n\r\nOn 23 September 2010, Smith joined Bournemouth on a month loan deal. He started his spell against Carlisle United in a game in which he won a sixty-fourth-minute penalty, which new team-mate Michael Symes scored. The game finished 2\u20130 to Bournemouth and left them third in the table.\r\n\r\nSmith was then part of the Bournemouth side who lost 2\u20130 at St Mary's in a south coast derby with Southampton. The youngster was sent off late on following two bookable offences. He missed the trip to Brighton & Hove Albion but returned for Bournemouth's 3\u20132 win against MK Dons, maintaining his 100% win ratio. This run was brought to an end when Smith played in a 2\u20131 defeat against Colchester United at Dean Court on 30 October 2010. On 1 April, Smith scored his first goal for Bournemouth an equalizer in the 94TH minute against Peterborough United at London Road helping the cherries come back from 3\u20131 down with 20 minutes to go after Steve Fletcher's bullet header made the score 3-2.\r\n\r\nOn 28 January 2014, Smith re-joined Bournemouth this time on a permanent basis signing a three-and-a-half year deal. On the 19th December 2015, he scored for the club in a 2-1 away win against West Bromwich Albion.\r\n\r\nSmith has represented England at various youth team levels.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Andrew Ronald Edward \"Drew\" Surman (born 20 August 1986) is a South African-born English footballer, who plays as a midfielder for Bournemouth. He spent the first five years of his career with Southampton where he played more than 100 games and has also played for Wolverhampton Wanderers and had a spell on loan at Walsall.\r\n\r\nSurman was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, where his parents had moved to from Britain, whilst his father worked for an insurance company. His parents returned to Southampton in 1995, and he joined Tyro League club Hedge End Rangers, where he was spotted by Southampton scouts and invited to join the Saints academy. He attended St. Mary's College in Bitterne and captained the football team.\r\n\r\nHe was the youngest player ever to play for the Saints Reserves until Theo Walcott took his record. He scored on his league debut when on loan to Walsall during the 2004\u201305 season, and, when he rejoined the Saints at the beginning of the 2005\u201306 season, he performed well on their pre-season tour of Scotland. He then enjoyed a successful loan spell with Bournemouth between August 2005 and January 2006, playing in every league game for the team, and scoring six goals. He might have figured in Southampton's FA Cup tie against MK Dons, but was cup-tied having played earlier in the season for Bournemouth against Tamworth.\r\n\r\nHe made his full team debut for Southampton on 25 January 2006 under new manager George Burley at home to Crystal Palace, and in the next league game scored his first Southampton goal in a 2\u20131 defeat against Plymouth Argyle. On 17 February 2007, he scored a hat-trick (two strikes from outside the penalty box and a penalty) in the 5\u20132 victory over Barnsley.\r\n\r\nHe became a vital part of the Southampton first team over the 2006\u201307 Season, and was a part of their unsuccessful play-off bid, losing on penalties to Derby County after a 4\u20134 aggregate draw, where his great strike wasn't enough to take Saints to Wembley.\r\n\r\nOn 31 July 2013, Bournemouth confirmed that they had completed the signing of Surman on a one-year loan deal. Surman played a vital role in Bournemouth's first team in the 2013\u201314 season, making 35 appearances for the club. On 1 September 2014, Surman completed a permanent move to the club.\r\n\r\nOn 2 May 2015, Surman was part of the Bournemouth team which won the Football League Championship title and promotion to the Premier League.\r\n\r\nAlthough qualified to play for South Africa, he was selected for the England U21 team for the European Championship qualifiers away to Montenegro on 7 September and Bulgaria on 11 September. In the match against Montenegro he came on as a second-half substitute and scored the final goal in a 3\u20130 victory, tapping the ball home in stoppage time from a knock-down by former Saints' trainee Dexter Blackstock.\r\n\r\nIn September 2012, Surman said that he had been \"approached\" to see if he was interested to play for South Africa. Though he declined, he said it was a \"great honour to be approached\". He went on to say that he has put any international ambitions \"on the back burner\" as he needs to concentrate fully on club matters and his family. He explained that \"it would be a lot, especially with the African Nations Cup, to be travelling around the world.\"\r\n\r\nIn April 2015 Surman's wife gave birth to the couple's third child.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Artur Boruc (Polish pronunciation: ; born 20 February 1980) is a Polish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Bournemouth.\r\n\r\nHe began his career in the Polish third division with hometown club Pogo\u0144 Siedlce. He joined Ekstraklasa team Legia Warsaw in 1999 and, whilst still a reserve, had a spell on loan at Dolcan Z\u0105bki in 2000. Boruc broke through to the Legia first team in 2002 and by 2003 had become the club's first choice goalkeeper. In the summer of 2005, he joined Scottish Premier League side Celtic. In his five years in Glasgow, Boruc made 221 appearances for the club, winning the league three times, the Scottish Cup once and the Scottish League Cup twice. He found himself at the centre of sectarian-related controversies for his conduct in Old Firm games against Rangers. Celtic fans nicknamed Boruc 'The Holy Goalie' for his devout Catholicism. He moved to Italy in 2010 to join Fiorentina, spending two years at the Serie A club before returning to Britain in 2012 to sign for Premier League side Southampton, moving to Bournemouth in 2015 after a season on loan.\r\n\r\nBoruc made his international debut against the Republic of Ireland in April 2004 and became a regular in the Polish international squad, earning over 50 caps. He represented the nation at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2008.\r\n\r\nBorn in Siedlce, Boruc began his career in 1998 at Pogo\u0144 Siedlce, in his hometown.\r\n\r\nBoruc was at the centre of many controversies during his Celtic tenure. His custom of blessing himself before games earned him the nickname of \"The Holy Goalie.\"\r\n\r\nOn 25 August 2006, Boruc was cautioned by the Strathclyde Police for a breach of the peace for making gestures in front of Rangers fans before a game earlier that year. According to the Sunday Herald, \"police reports highlighted three hand gestures made by 26-year-old Boruc \u2026 a V sign at the crowd, another obscene gesture at the crowd and a blessing.\" The gestures were not caught on video and the caution was issued on the basis of police reports and witness statements. This incident has led to him attaining the nickname \"The Holy Goalie\".\r\n\r\nThe Procurator Fiscal said Boruc \"was seen by members of the public and police officers to bless himself. Witnesses describe him smiling or laughing at a Rangers section of the crowd and making 'come on' gestures. This action appeared to incense a section of the crowd to react in such a way that police officers and security personnel had to become involved to calm the situation. The police reported that it took 10 minutes to restore normality in the crowd.\" According to a cross-party working group of the Scottish Parliament, \"the sign of the cross in itself is an expression of the Roman Catholic faith; however, using it to alarm, upset or provoke others might be a breach of the peace at common law.\"\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Church condemned the legal action, however, expressing regret that \"Scotland seems to have made itself one of the few countries in the world where this simple religious gesture is considered an offence.\" Following extensive press comment, the Crown Office issued a statement on 28 August 2006 stressing that the \"very limited\" action had been taken against Boruc for gestures made toward Rangers supporters rather than for crossing himself, and that it would not take action against individuals for \"acts of religious observance.\" According to BBC News Online, the caution \"brought the issue of sectarianism in Scotland back into sharp focus.\" The Roman Catholic Church welcomed the Crown Office's clarification of the limited action taken against Boruc, particularly the statement that it \"did not in any way refer to the act of blessing himself.\"\r\n\r\nOn 17 December 2006, Boruc again crossed himself during his first Old Firm game since the caution, drawing \"a roar\" from the Rangers fans behind his goal. A spokesman for Celtic defended his gesture, stating \"the police have said they have no problem with Artur Boruc in this regard and neither does Celtic Football Club.\"\r\n\r\nBoruc courted further controversy in April 2008 when he displayed a T-shirt saying \"God bless the Pope\" and bearing a picture of Pope John Paul II after a game against Rangers, and also in May 2007 when he waved a flag proclaiming Celtic the \"champions\" following a match against Rangers.",

Gosling is a versatile player, having operated as a box-to-box midfielder on several occasions and occasionally deputised at right back to accommodate substitutions. His previous clubs are Newcastle United, Plymouth Argyle and Everton.\r\n\r\nBorn in Brixham, Devon, Gosling was spotted by Plymouth Argyle scouts when he was playing in the under-12 side of hometown club Brixham United. On 9 December 2006, at age 16 years and 310 days, he made his professional debut against Hull City, coming on as a first-half substitute for injured Captain Paul Wotton and became the fourth youngest debutant. His full debut came on New Year's Day 2007, against Southampton at Home Park. He proved his versatility in a solid performance, by moving from right-midfield to right-back after an early injury to defender Mathias Kouo-Doumb\u00e9.\r\n\r\nGosling established himself as a regular in the reserve team, and his impressive performances were noticed by manager Ian Holloway. At the beginning of March 2007 he trained for a week with Premiership club Chelsea along with team-mates Luke Summerfield and Scott Sinclair. That same year he was named The Herald's Young Sports Personality of the Year in 2007.\r\n\r\nGosling earned himself a call-up to the England Under-17s squad for the UEFA European U17 Championship Qualifying Round in Bosnia at the end of March 2007 after displaying good form for the Pilgrims, and was also included in the England U17 squad for the 2007 European Championships in Belgium. England finished twenty-third in that tournament, qualifying for the 2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup, with Gosling also making the tournament squad. He was promoted to the under-19 squad for the 2008 European Championships.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2009, Gosling was called up for the final squad to participate in the U19 European Championship and started in every game. He scored a goal against Ukraine in the group stage match to give England the lead but Ukraine equalised to draw 2\u20132. England ended the tournament as runners-up to Ukraine.\r\n\r\nGosling was called up to the England U21 squad for the first time as a replacement for injured clubmate Jack Rodwell. He was named as a substitute in Stuart Pearce's 18-man squad for the double qualifier against Portugal on 14 November and Lithuania three days later. He made his debut in the match when he came on as an extra time substitute for Fabian Delph against Portugal.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Harry Nicholas Arter (born 28 December 1989) is an Irish footballer who plays as a midfielder for A.F.C. Bournemouth. He began his career at Charlton Athletic, where he made one substitute appearance in 2007 and was loaned to non-league Staines Town and Welling United before leaving for Woking. After one season at Woking, he returned to The Football League with Bournemouth, becoming a regular following a loan to Carlisle United in 2011. He contributed to Bournemouth's promotion to the Championship in 2013, and to the Premier League two years later.\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in England, Arter represents the Republic of Ireland internationally. He played for the nation at under-17 and under-19 level, and made his senior debut in June 2015.\r\n\r\nBorn in Sidcup, in the London borough of Bexley, Arter began his career at Charlton Athletic. He made his professional debut, and only appearance for the club, on 25 September 2007 in the third round of the League Cup, away to Luton Town. He came on as an 86th-minute substitute for Svetoslav Todorov as Charlton lost 1\u20133 after extra time.\r\n\r\nIn the 2008\u201309 season, he had loan spells with Staines Town and Welling United.\r\n\r\nOn 7 June 2010, Arter joined League One club Bournemouth for an undisclosed fee, signed by Eddie Howe. Two months later, he made his debut in their first match of the season, away to his former team Charlton. He was booked in the first half for a foul on Akpo Sodje and substituted at half time for Michael Symes as Bournemouth lost 0\u20131. Having fallen out of favour, on 4 March 2011, Arter went on a one-month loan to fellow League One team Carlisle United. The next day he made his debut for the club, replacing Liam Noble for the last 30 minutes away to Brighton & Hove Albion. He scored an added-time equaliser, the first of his professional career, but a minute later Liam Bridcutt scored Brighton's winner in a 4\u20133 victory.\r\n\r\nOn 13 August 2011, Arter replaced Mark Molesley in the 66th minute of a game against Sheffield Wednesday at Dean Court, and 17 minutes later confirmed a 2\u20130 win with his first goal for the club. Overall, he scored 5 goals in 34 league matches that season.\r\n\r\nArter was sent off after 26 minutes on 25 August 2012, in Bournemouth's 1\u20131 draw at Preston North End. On 20 October, in Howe's first match back in charge, Arter scored in a 3\u20131 home win over Tranmere Rovers. Altogether, he scored 8 goals in 37 league matches, including in the 3\u20131 win for the penultimate game of the season against Carlisle on 20 April 2013, which secured Bournemouth promotion to the Championship.\r\n\r\nArter was one of Bournemouth's prominent players in the 2014\u201315 season, contributing 9 goals from 43 matches, and subsequently was voted Supporters\u2019 Player of the Season. On 25 October 2014, Arter played as Bournemouth beat Birmingham City 8\u20130 away to set a club record win, the result came only 1 week after fellow south coast club Southampton had beaten Sunderland 8-0. Throughout the season Arter and midfielder Andrew Surman formed a formidable partnership, with Arter more the attacking and Surman the more defensive of the two. Harry was known for his left footed strikes from range, notably scoring the second goal in the 3-0 home victory over promotion rivals Middlesbrough and first goal in the 1-1 away draw against 2nd placed Watford. On April 27, 2015 Arter played in the 3-0 home victory against Bolton, the win all but sealed Bournemouth\u2019s promotion to the Premier League. Five days later, Arter scored the second goal in the 3-0 away win against his former club Charlton, the win fully sealed promotion and, thanks to Watford drawing their last match in injury time, the Championship title. This was the first time Bournemouth had been promoted into England\u2019s top flight in the club's 125-year history.\r\n\r\nDue to groin and hip complaints after his international debut, Arter missed the start of their first top-flight season. He made his Premier League debut on 1 November 2015 as he played 73 minutes in their 2\u20130 loss away to Southampton.\r\n\r\nArter played for the Republic of Ireland under-17 and under-19 teams, being eligible through his Sligo-born grandparents.\r\n\r\nIn February 2015, Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill said that Arter was on his radar and could be called up to the squad for the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying game against Poland. He earned his first call-up for that game on 12 March, following what O'Neill described as a \"very good season\", but did not play in it. He made his senior debut on 7 June 2015, as a 63rd-minute substitute for Glenn Whelan in a 0\u20130 draw in a friendly against England at the Aviva Stadium. He made his full international debut against the Netherlands in a 1-1 draw in Dublin on 27 May 2016, in which he was awarded man of the match.\r\n\r\nArter is the brother-in-law of former England captain Scott Parker, who is married to his sister Carly. They both began their careers at Charlton.\r\n\r\nIn December 2015, Harry Arter and his partner suffered a family tragedy when their daughter died at birth. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe paid tribute to Arter following a 2\u20131 win over Manchester United on 12 December. Howe dedicated the win to Arter and said it had been \"a hugely emotional week for him.\"",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Joshua Christian Kojo \"Josh\" King (born 15 January 1992) is a Norwegian professional footballer who plays as a striker or a winger for Premier League club Bournemouth and the Norway national team.\r\n\r\nKing was signed by Manchester United from V\u00e5lerenga in 2008. After loan spells with Preston North End, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Hull City and Blackburn Rovers, he signed permanently with Blackburn in January 2013. He switched to Bournemouth in May 2015.\r\n\r\nAfter representing Norway at under-15, under-16, under-18, under-19 and under-21 levels, King made his senior international debut against Iceland in 2012, and scored his first international goal against Cyprus later that year.\r\n\r\nBorn in Oslo, to a Gambian father and a Norwegian mother, King grew up in the suburb of Roms\u00e5s. He began his career with the local club, Roms\u00e5s IL, before switching to V\u00e5lerenga when he was 15. While at V\u00e5lerenga, King trained with English side Manchester United on multiple occasions, but UEFA rules prevented him from signing a contract with the club until he was 16. He also had trial offers from Chelsea, Sunderland and Ipswich Town, but rejected those in favour of Manchester United.\r\n\r\nAfter representing Norway at youth international level, Egil Olsen called up King to Norway's squad for two World Cup qualifiers in September 2012. He made his debut against Iceland on 7 September 2012, when he replaced Mohammed Abdellaoue after 65 minutes. King had the ball in the back of the net eight minutes later, but the goal was disallowed. Four days later in Norway's next match, he replaced Abdellaoue at half time against Slovenia. King replaced Alexander S\u00f8derlund as a substitute at half time against Cyprus in Larnaca on 16 October 2012, then won a penalty and scored the last goal in Norway's 3\u20131 victory.\r\n\r\nHe was included in the Norwegian squad for the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, but as he was a regular member of the senior squad he had to play the World Cup qualifying match against Albania, along with his under-21 teammates Valon Berisha, H\u00e5vard Nordtveit and Markus Henriksen before they traveled to the championship in Israel. King appeared in the under-21 team's matches against Italy U-21 and Spain U-21 during the championship.\r\n\r\nHe scored his second full international goal in his next appearance, scoring the second goal in a 2\u20130 victory over Cyprus on 6 September 2013. On 10 October 2014, he scored two goals against Malta in a 3\u20130 away win in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying, but was dropped by manager Per-Mathias H\u00f8gmo from their play-off against Hungary in place of Veton Berisha, Marcus Pedersen and Alexander S\u00f8derlund.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Marc Anthony Pugh (born 2 April 1987) is an English professional footballer who plays for Premier League club Bournemouth. He plays mainly as a winger but can also play as a midfielder.\r\n\r\nPugh started his career with Burnley, where he progressed through the youth system. He was released by the club having made his first team while on loan at Kidderminster Harriers and signed a short-term contract with Bury in 2006. Pugh later signed a professional contract at the club and after rejecting an extended contract in 2007 he signed for Shrewsbury Town. He was loaned out to Luton Town and Hereford United, joining the latter permanently in 2009.\r\n\r\nPugh left Hereford after one season to sign for Bournemouth in 2010, where he was top scorer in his first two seasons. He won promotion from League One in 2013 and the Championship two years later, making over 200 appearances for the club. Pugh has played and scored in all five of England's nationwide football divisions.\r\n\r\nPugh started his career with First Division club Burnley where, at a young age, he started as a Centre of Excellence player, and gradually worked his way up through the ranks to become an apprentice in 2003. As a first year apprentice he played for the youth and reserve teams and due to his great goalscoring record, which led to him being named on the bench for two first team matches in the League Cup, they decided to keep him on for a third year. As a third year apprentice he scored 15 goals for the club's reserve and youth team. This led to him to being loaned out to Kidderminster Harriers of the Conference National in November 2005 to play first team football. He made his debut for Kidderminster after coming on as an 86th minute substitute in a 3\u20131 defeat to Stevenage Borough. He converted a Simon Heslop cross during a match against Dagenham & Redbridge to score his first career goal, which helped Kidderminster to a 3\u20131 victory. Also, during a match he displayed a smart piece of skill which involved flicking the ball over an opponents head with his heel, then crossing the ball in for a teammate to score; this move was featured on Soccer AM's showboating section.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Burnley on 13 December 2005 after picking up a groin injury, but returned to Kidderminster for a second loan spell on 7 January 2006. This spell ended on 26 January 2006 so Pugh could concentrate on his career at Burnley, having made 10 appearances and scored 1 goal while at Kidderminster. He learned that he would not receive a professional contract at Burnley in February 2006, which was partly because both Chris McCann and Kyle Lafferty had both already received professional contracts and they were only second year apprentices.\r\n\r\nPugh primarily plays as a winger but can also play as an attacking midfielder. He has been noted for his dribbling skills and his ability to get past opposition players, and in February 2015 was praised by manager Eddie Howe for adding \"real intelligence with his movement\".\r\n\r\nPugh was born in Bacup, Lancashire to Tony and Denise. He grew up in Stacksteads and attended All Saints' Catholic High School, Rawtenstall. He is married to Laura, with whom he has two daughters.",

Instead he joined Bradford City as a trainee in 2002 after being spotted playing for South Nottingham College. He made his debut for Bradford on 16 November 2002 against Nottingham Forest days after he came on as a substitute for England under 18s against France. He made more than 50 starts for the Bantams, scoring his first career goal in a game against Crystal Palace, before being sold for \u00a3200,000 by the administrators in 2004. Bradford received offers from Sunderland and Sheffield United, with Francis choosing the latter to be nearer his home in Nottingham and link up with manager Neil Warnock.\r\n\r\nCompetition for places meant that Francis was never quite able to hold down a regular place at Bramall Lane, restricting him to just 15 appearances for the Blades during his two-year sojourn. He spent most of the 2005\u201306 season on loan with Grimsby Town and then Tranmere Rovers (where he scored once against Swansea City). His final appearance for Sheffield United was as a late substitute at Luton in the penultimate game of the season.\r\n\r\nOn 13 June 2006, Francis transferred to League One side Southend United for an undisclosed fee, signing a three-year contract.\r\n\r\nIn June 2008, he was initially transfer listed by Southend United after failing to agree a new contract, but two weeks later he signed for another two years with Southend.\r\n\r\nIn January 2010 Southend reluctantly accepted an offer for Francis from Peterborough United but he failed to agree personal terms. Following Southend's relegation in to League Two, Francis stated that he had no desire to leave the relegated club. Three weeks later, Southend accepted a \u00a3150,000 offer for Francis from Brentford.\r\n\r\nOn 8 July 2010 new Southend manager Paul Sturrock agreed to cancel the defenders contract, allowing him to find a new club as a free agent. On 30 July Francis signed for Charlton Athletic.\r\n\r\nOn 7 November 2011, Francis signed on loan to AFC Bournemouth and the deal was made permanent in January 2012. Francis was instrumental in Bournemouth's promotion to The Football League Championship in 2012-2013 and won Players' Player of the Season. In Bournemouth's first season in the second tier of English football since 1990, Francis played all but 45-minutes of the season.  In the summer of 2014, Francis signed a further contract for three-years at AFC Bournemouth.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Andre Anthony Gray (born 26 June 1991) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Burnley. A product of the Shrewsbury Town youth system, Gray came to prominence after scoring 57 goals in 111 appearances in a two-season spell with Luton Town. He represented England C at international level.\r\n\r\nGray began his career in the academy at hometown club Wolverhampton Wanderers, but was released at age 13. Gray joined the youth setup at League Two side Shrewsbury Town in 2004, signing his first professional one-year contract prior to the start of the 2009\u201310 season. Awarded the number 20 shirt, he made his debut on the opening day of the season, coming on as an 89th-minute substitute for Nathan Elder in the Shrews' 3\u20131 win over Burton Albion. An injury crisis saw Gray make four further cameos, with what would be his final appearance for the club coming as a 57th minute replacement for Kris Bright in a 2\u20130 Football League Trophy second round defeat to Accrington Stanley on 20 October. He spent periods of the 2009\u201310 season away on loan, but competition for places meant that Gray was relegated to the reserve team substitutes' bench. Gray was released by the Shrews on 14 May 2010, having made just five appearances for the club. Looking back on his time at Shrewsbury, Gray said \"I was at the stage in my life where I thought everything was set for me. I didn\u2019t really care about playing in Shrewsbury\u2019s reserves, which it shouldn\u2019t have been\".\r\n\r\nOn 21 August 2015, Gray joined Championship side Burnley on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee \u2013 believed to be a club-record \u00a36m deal \u2013 double the previous record jointly held by George Boyd and Steven Fletcher. Gray signed on the eve of Brentford's Championship clash at Turf Moor but wasn't eligible to make his debut against his former club, having signed too late.\r\n\r\nGray's former club Luton Town revealed their financial windfall after the striker's transfer to Burnley. A club statement read: \u201cWe are guaranteed to receive a shade over \u00a31.1m from the fee which will be spread over three seasons; an initial figure approaching \u00a3300,000 followed by two of just over \u00a3400,000 each\".\r\n\r\nOn 29 August 2015, Gray made his Burnley debut in a 2\u20131 away victory to Bristol City at Ashton Gate.\r\n\r\nGray was born in Wolverhampton, West Midlands. He was introduced to football by his grandfather and suffered heartbreak at age 13 when his grandfather died. Acting as a mentor and father figure for his younger half-brother Cody, Gray said \"I know what my grandad wants me to do and that\u2019s look after my family. It\u2019s driving me to work harder\". He is an Arsenal supporter. Gray has a four-inch scar on his left cheek having been stabbed in the face in Wolverhampton in a gang-related incident in 2011. He spoke in May 2015 of having started to grow out of the gang lifestyle around the time of the incident and credited his mother, close friends and Luton Town for turning his life around.\r\n\r\nGray's goalscoring record for Luton in the final months of the 2011\u201312 season raised the attention of the England C team and he was named in the squad for an International Challenge Trophy match against Russia U23 in June 2012. He made his debut in a 4\u20130 defeat, playing the full 90 minutes. He was later called into the squad to face Belgium U23 in September 2012. He came on as a half time substitute for Stephen Brogan and scored his first international goal with the winner in a 2\u20131 victory. The win saw England C qualify for the semi-final of the International Challenge Trophy. He played in the semi-final on 5 February 2013 against Turkey A2, which England C lost 1\u20130. Gray captained England C in the second half of a 6\u20131 friendly win over Bermuda on 5 June 2013, scoring the team's sixth goal. He appeared again in a 2\u20132 friendly draw with Czech Republic U21 in November 2013, starting the match and lasting 71 minutes before being replaced by Dan Fitchett. Gray played in a friendly versus Jordan U23 at King Abdullah Stadium in Amman on 4 March 2014, starting in the 1\u20130 victory and being replaced by Dan Fitchett at half time. Gray's return to the Football League in June 2014 meant that he was no longer eligible for England C. He won six caps and scored two goals.",

He previously played for Paulton Rovers, Plymouth Argyle, Oxford United, Salisbury City, Eastbourne Borough, Torquay United and Brighton & Hove Albion. He has been capped by Austria at international level, making one appearance for their under-20 team.\r\n\r\nBarnes began his career as a prolific goalscorer with local club Paulton Rovers of the Southern League. He had an extended trial with Championship club Plymouth Argyle in March 2007, and sufficiently impressed to be awarded with an eighteen-month contract by the club, having scored several goals for the reserve team. He made his Plymouth debut in the first round of the League Cup in August 2007 against Wycombe Wanderers, coming on as a substitute for first-team regular Sylvan Ebanks-Blake.\r\n\r\nHe subsequently found first-team opportunities hard to come by, and was sent on loan to Conference side Oxford United in November 2007 to gain some experience. Barnes featured five times for Oxford United, including two FA Cup ties against Southend United, before returning to Plymouth. He was sent out on loan again in March 2008 to another Conference club, this time to Salisbury City. He featured in five league matches for the club but did not find the back of the net.\r\n\r\nBarnes was loaned out for a third time in November 2008 to Eastbourne Borough, with team-mate Daniel Smith. He impressed enough for his loan to be extended by a month, before he was recalled by Plymouth Argyle in January 2009, ahead of the club's match against Bristol City. He made his league debut for the Pilgrims against Wolves at Molineux, scoring his first goal for the club against Coventry City. His performances at the back-end of the 2008\u201309 season were rewarded when he signed a two-year contract extension in May 2009.\r\n\r\nHe joined League Two club Torquay United on loan until the end of the season in February 2010, but returned a month later having made six appearances.\r\n\r\nDespite being born in Bath to English parents, Barnes qualifies to represent Austria courtesy of his paternal grandmother, who was born in the country. He was spotted by Austrian officials while on a pre-season tour with Plymouth Argyle in July 2008, and as a result he was called up to their Under-20 team to face Switzerland on 19 August 2008, the game was part of a four nation friendly tournament featuring Austria, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. Barnes made his debut as a substitute in the 73rd minute replacing FC Wacker Innsbruck's Julius Perstaller in front of 250 spectators.",

He signed a two-year contract that will keep him until 2011.\r\n\r\nMee was given his first real test of first-team experience when he was taken on City's US tour in the summer of 2010, with club manager Roberto Mancini expressing that he wanted to blood his youth players and have a chance to see what they could do at a higher level than reserve fixtures. Mee made up two appearances, against Portland Timbers and New York Red Bulls.\r\n\r\nAfter being given number 41 shirt, Mee followed up his tour appearances with a starting line-up appearance in the Carling Cup against West Bromwich Albion on 22 September 2010 in a 2\u20131 away loss.

    "strDescriptionEN": "Dean Edward Marney (born 31 January 1984) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Burnley.\r\n\r\nBorn in Barking, London, Marney is a box-to-box midfielder and a product of the Tottenham Hotspur youth system. Although predominantly a midfielder he showed an aptitude at right back and understudied to then Spurs right back Stephen Carr, and was viewed by many as the Irish international's natural successor. He really emerged onto the scene in a mid season friendly against Irish champions Bohemians putting in a man of the match performance from right back. Unable to get his start as a young player in the Tottenham team, he was loaned out early on in his career to Swindon Town.\r\n\r\nHis initial first team action for Spurs came in August 2003, against Birmingham City. By January 2004 he had joined Queens Park Rangers on loan, as by that time Spurs had strengthened their strike force. Upon his return he was handed his debut start, but that would be his only appearance until November 2004, when he joined Gillingham on loan.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Tottenham, he was immediately thrown in at the deep end, as a last minute choice to face an Everton team on 1 January, in which he scored the first and last goals of the match in a 5\u20132 victory, the second being a superb 25-yard curler into the top right corner.\r\n\r\nHe struggled with form until February 2005, the month in which he participated in his first international, an England under-21 match versus the Netherlands. He has not appeared for England since then.\r\n\r\nAfter considerable squad strengthening in the early part of the 2005\u201306 season, which included the signings of Edgar Davids and Jermaine Jenas, he found himself out of action, and moved for a season-long loan to Norwich City in the hope of winning them promotion back to the Premier League. However his time at Norwich City was cut short due to injury and he returned to Tottenham on 31 October 2005.\r\n\r\nBurnley manager Brian Laws made Marney his first summer signing on 28 May 2010. Marney scored his first goal for Burnley in a 3\u20133 draw with Sheffield United on 16 October 2010.\r\n\r\nMarney struggled to establish himself in the Burnley team in his first season at the club, having spells in and out of the side. For the opening few games of his second season, Marney found himself out of favour and used predominantly as a substitute. However, a string of impressive performance from the midfielder saw him given an extended run in the side and Marney finished the season as one of the Clarets most impressive performers. The 2012-13 season is considered by many to be the best of Marneys career to date, being an almost ever-present in the Clarets side missing matches only through suspension and injury. Marney helped Burnley stave off relegation and eventually finish 11th in the Championship.\r\n\r\nMarney began the 2013-14 season in a similar vein, performing very well during pre-season and the opening matches of the Football League Championship, where he formed an effective partnership with former Wolves and Wigan Athletic midfielder, David Jones, who signed for the Clarets in the summer. Over his first 3 seasons with Burnley he appeared in approximately 75% of their league games and, with his contract about to expire in 2013, signed a new 2-year deal.\r\n\r\nMarney represented England at international gaining one cap for the England under-21 side in England's 2\u20131 defeat to Netherlands U-21 in February 2005. He has not appeared for England since then.\r\n\r\nMarney is a free-flowing midfielder and has proven to be a key factor in distribution throughout the teams he has played for. He has recently, at his latest club Burnley, developed a reputation of being a 'hard man' of football, picking up 12 yellow cards and 1 red card in the 2012\u201313 season, higher than all of his Burnley colleagues and the second in the Championship. He is not shy of a challenge but shows good control of his aggression.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "George Jan Boyd (born 2 October 1985) is a professional footballer who plays as a winger for Burnley.\r\n\r\nBoyd started his career in the Charlton Athletic youth system, joining Stevenage Borough of the Conference National in 2001 and making his first-team debut in 2002. Boyd spent five seasons at Stevenage, scoring over thirty goals from midfield in all competitions. He left in January 2007 to join League Two side Peterborough United for a fee of \u00a3260,000, and won two successive promotions in the 2007\u201308 and 2008\u201309 seasons. In March 2010, Boyd joined Nottingham Forest on loan until the end of the 2009\u201310 season. On return to his parent club in July 2010, Boyd signed a new three-year contract at Peterborough. In February 2013, Boyd joined Hull City on loan for the remainder of the 2012\u201313 season, and he helped the club earn promotion back to the Premier League during his time there. Shortly after the end of the season, he signed for the club on a permanent basis.\r\n\r\nHe also played for the England National Game XI team, who represent England at non-League level, from 2005 to 2006, earning six caps and scoring one goal. Boyd was born and raised in England, and also qualified to play for Scotland through his maternal grandfather. After playing for the Scotland B team in 2009, he earned his first cap at senior level in 2013.\r\n\r\nOn 1 September 2014, Burnley signed Boyd on a three-year deal. On 18 October Boyd scored his first Premier League goal in a losing effort against West Ham United F.C. in a 3\u20131 defeat for the clarets. On 2 December Boyd scored his second league goal of the season in a 1\u20131 draw with Newcastle. On 28 December Boyd scored the opening goal for Burnley in a 2\u20132 draw over Manchester City. On 1 January 2015 Boyd scored the equaliser in the 86th minute in a 3\u20133 draw over Newcastle. On 14 March Boyd scored the winner against Manchester City in the 61st minute.\r\n\r\nBoyd is generally deployed as a winger, and has been used on the left-wing throughout the majority of his career. He has described himself as a winger, but has stated that he prefers to play \"in the hole\" because the position allows him to get more time on the ball. He has expressed his willingness to \"play anywhere\" to help the team, believing his versatility across the midfield and attacking areas to be one of his main strong-points. He said \"I have played on both sides of the park and will always try my best to do a good job regardless of where the manager plays me\". Under former Peterborough United manager, Jim Gannon, Boyd was given a \"free-role\", essentially playing across the midfield and behind the strikers. Gannon said \"if we can get him free in attacking areas he can be a great creative force\". Gannon believes that Boyd is at his best when he \"is saved from doing defensive work that wingers may have to do\", and as a result, during Gannon's short spell at Peterborough, was deployed just behind the strikers as part of a 3\u20134\u20131\u20132 formation. Boyd has also been used as a striker by manager Mark Stimson during the first-half of Stevenage's 2006\u201307 campaign. He is predominantly left-footed, and scores the majority of his goals with his left-foot, but is also comfortable using his right. Kieran Trippier, Boyd's team-mate at Burnley, said of Boyd: \"He's great to play with, with a good left foot and a great engine\".\r\n\r\nDuring his time at Stevenage, Boyd earned the nickname \"The White Pel\u00e9\" \u2013 this was down to his use of tricks, as well as the amount of flair Boyd brought to the team at such a young age. Stevenage manager Graham Westley, who gave Boyd his first run of games in the first-team, described Boyd as a \"special talent\" following his two goals away at Woking in August 2005. Westley proceeded to call Boyd \"gifted\", and a player with \"fantastic technical ability\". He has been labelled a creative and flamboyant midfielder, and described as \"a player who will create goalscoring opportunities all game long\". Boyd has stated that he considers assisting goals a \"big part of his game\", and says \"I try to create chances for other players and that gives me just as much pleasure as scoring\". Boyd's creative nature is emphasised by the fact that he has assisted over 50 goals for Peterborough during his time at London Road. Peterborough United manager Darren Ferguson has said that Boyd \"has the tendency, and ability, to score goals from long distance\", talking after Boyd's 35-yard volley against Boston United. This was further highlighted when Boyd scored from just inside the opposition's half in a win against Huddersfield Town in October 2012. Boyd collected a Saido Berahino knock-down, before hitting a dipping volley from the edge of the centre circle. Manager Darren Ferguson stated \u2014 \"If Lionel Messi had done it you'd be seeing it over again. For vision and execution it was one of the best I have seen\". Boyd also scored several long range goals during his time at Stevenage, scoring from outside the area on seven different occasions; most notably on the half-volley from 30 yards in a game against Cambridge United in January 2006.\r\n\r\nBoyd believes that he needs to work on his turn of pace and also improve his heading ability, and considers these as his main weaknesses. Former manager Darren Ferguson said \"there might be those who say he lacks a little bit of pace but what he does not have in his legs he has in his head\". In his career, Boyd has only ever scored three headed goals, and says that he is much more comfortable with the ball at his feet.",

He began his career at Oldham Athletic, where he made 89 appearances before leaving in 2014.\r\n\r\nTarkowski grew up in New Moston, Manchester and joined League One side Oldham Athletic on a two-year scholarship in May 2009. He made his reserve team debut in October 2009. A centre back, Tarkowski was called up to the first team for the first time for a league match versus Plymouth Argyle on 15 January 2011. His senior debut came on 22 January, coming on as an 80th-minute substitute for the injured Neal Trotman in a 2\u20131 home win over Brentford. Tarkowski made his first Latics start in a 1\u20130 defeat to Leyton Orient on 12 March and played the full 90 minutes. He was awarded a two-year professional contract by the club in May 2011. He made 9 appearances during the second half of the 2010\u201311 season.\r\n\r\nTarkowski had to wait until 10 December 2011 to make his first appearance of the 2011\u201312 season, when he came on as a 61st-minute substitute for Jean-Yves Mvoto in a 2\u20130 home defeat to Sheffield Wednesday. A half time substitute appearance in Oldham's 2\u20131 Football League Trophy Northern Area final first leg defeat to Chesterfield on 30 January 2012 kicked off a run which saw Tarkowski included in almost all of Oldham's first team squads until the end of the season. Tarkowski crowned his run of appearances by scoring his first senior goal for the club on the final day of the season in a 2\u20131 win over Carlisle United. He made 18 appearances during the 2011\u201312 season and scored one goal.\r\n\r\nOn 1 February 2016, Tarkowski signed a three-and-a-half year deal with Championship club Burnley for an undisclosed fee.\r\n\r\nTarkowski attended New Moston Primary School and Failsworth High School, which he left in 2009. He is a Manchester United fan and admired David Beckham and Paul Scholes while growing up.",

He was born and raised in Huyton, Merseyside. He began his football career with Manchester City in 2002 after working his way through their youth system. His appearances in the senior side gradually increased over the following five years and he made more than 150 for the club. He earned his first cap for the England national team in February 2007, despite his criticism of some of the team's players. He then joined Newcastle United for a fee of \u00a35.8 million in July 2007. After four years with the club, he joined Queens Park Rangers in August 2011, from where he was loaned to Marseille in 2012.\r\n\r\nBarton's career and life have been marked by numerous controversial incidents and disciplinary problems and he has been convicted twice on charges of violence. On 20 May 2008 he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for common assault and affray during an incident in Liverpool City Centre. Barton served 77 days of this prison term, being released on 28 July 2008. On 1 July 2008 he was also given a four months suspended sentence after admitting assault occasioning actual bodily harm on former teammate Ousmane Dabo during a training ground dispute on 1 May 2007. This incident effectively ended his Manchester City career. Barton has been charged with violent conduct three times by The Football Association: for the assault on Dabo, for punching Morten Gamst Pedersen in the stomach and for attacking three players on the final day of the 2011\u201312 season.",

He can play in a number of defensive positions but is a natural right back.\r\n\r\nBorn in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, Lowton joined Sheffield United's academy in 2004. He spent time on loan with both non-league Sheffield and Hungarian side Ferencv\u00e1ros before making the break into United's first team in 2010. He played regularly for two seasons before being sold to Aston Villa in 2012. After three seasons and 72 Premier League appearances, he joined Burnley in 2015.\r\n\r\nLowton was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. He joined Sheffield United aged fifteen after a brief spell with Leeds United and progressed through Sheffield United's youth set up to reserve level, converting from a full-back to a central defensive role in the process. After spending a spell on loan at Sheffield FC in 2008, in January 2009 Lowton went out on loan to Sheffield United's Hungarian sister club Ferencv\u00e1ros, along with fellow reserve player Sam Wedgbury, to get first-team experience. He made his d\u00e9but in the Hungarian League Cup the next month, making eighteen appearances before returning to United towards the end of the season.\r\n\r\nBack in the Championship, Lowton found himself on the fringes of the first team and duly made his Blades d\u00e9but in a 1\u20131 draw with Cardiff City at the end of March 2010, coming on as a late substitute, before making his full d\u00e9but for the club in the final game of the season.\r\n\r\nThe following season, Lowton started Sheffield United's opening day fixture, away to Cardiff City, but was issued with a straight red card. Despite this setback, he returned to the first-team picture and was rewarded with a new contract at the end of September. Lowton continued a run of substitute appearances and rewarded United's faith by scoring his first senior goal in mid-October, netting in a 3\u20133 home draw with Burnley. Lowton played regularly for the remainder of the season, scoring four goals in all, but couldn't prevent the club from slipping to relegation.\r\n\r\nWith the Blades now in League One, Lowton remained a key player and was rewarded with an extended contract in August 2011, making 55 appearances in total for the Blades during the following season and scoring one goal.",

However injuries disrupted his time in the top flight before the club's relegation after three seasons. He joined Stoke City in August 2012 for an undisclosed fee. Kightly spent the 2012\u201313 season at Stoke before joining Burnley on loan in August 2013. After helping the Clarets gain promotion to the Premier League he made the move permanent in June 2014.\r\n\r\nBorn in Basildon, Kightly played schoolboy football for Tottenham Hotspur but was released and subsequently picked up by his hometown team, non-League Basildon United. His stay was short and was soon back in professional football, signing a two-year scholarship with Southend United on 16 December 2002 following a five-game trial period. He made his league debut for the club on 3 May 2003, in a 1\u20130 defeat at Exeter City.\r\n\r\nAlthough featuring in all their cup games of this time, scoring once in the Football League Trophy against Luton Town, he made only 13 league appearances over three different seasons for them. On 22 October 2004, he joined Farnborough Town on loan, spending three months with the club before returning to Southend United on 20 January 2005. He was released at the end of the season by Southend manager Steve Tilson.\r\n\r\nOn 2 September Kightly joined Burnley on loan for the 2013\u201314 season. He scored his first goal for Burnley in a 1\u20130 win over Barnsley on 7 December 2013. Kightly scored five goals in 38 games for Burnley as they gained promotion to the Premier League. He made his move to Turf Moor permanent on 27 June 2014, signing a three-year contract.\r\n\r\nKightly was called into the England U21 squad in August 2007 for a friendly against Romania and went on to make his debut, playing the first half of the game.\r\n\r\nKightly has a daughter called Alexa and a son Leo. He grew up supporting Manchester United but switched allegiances to Tottenham Hotspur after he realised that he was glory hunting.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Samuel Michael \"Sam\" Vokes (born 21 October 1989) is a professional footballer who plays as a striker for English club Burnley and the Wales national team.\r\n\r\nVokes began his professional career at then League One Bournemouth, making his debut in 2006. His form there earned a move to Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he helped them win promotion to the Premier League in his first season.\r\n\r\nHe has become an established member of the Welsh national team, who he has also represented at under-21 level. Born and raised in England, Vokes is eligible to represent Wales through a grandfather born there.\r\n\r\nBorn in Southampton and raised in Lymington, Vokes stepped up into Bournemouth's first team on 5 December 2006 in a 2\u20130 victory over Nottingham Forest. His first senior goal came in a 1\u20131 draw at Gillingham on 16 December. This form saw the club give him a three-and-a-half-year professional contract during the following month.\r\n\r\nThe striker remained at Bournemouth during the 2007\u201308 season, despite being linked to several other clubs, including Newcastle United, Aston Villa, Everton and Celtic. The youngster was a bright spark in an otherwise tumultuous season for the Cherries as they were embroiled in a club ownership saga. His 12-goal tally could not prevent Bournemouth from being relegated to League Two.\r\n\r\nOn 31 July 2012, Vokes joined Championship side Burnley permanently signing a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee, believed to be \u00a3350k. On 2 December, Vokes scored an equalising goal for Burnley in the 89th-minute against fierce rivals Blackburn Rovers a game which ended 1\u20131. Despite this goal, Vokes struggled to establish himself in the first eleven and was used predominantly as a substitute. This was mainly down to the form of top scorer Charlie Austin, with manager Sean Dyche often opting to partner Austin with fellow strikers Martin Paterson or Danny Ings, both being quicker and more mobile than Vokes.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the 2013\u20132014 Championship season, Burnley agreed a deal with Queens Park Rangers for the transfer of Charlie Austin, who had attracted lots of attention from Premier League teams throughout the summer. With Austin moving out of the club, this gave Vokes his long awaited chance in the starting eleven, and he finished the season with 21 goals in 44 games.\r\n\r\nOn 8 August 2015, on the opening day of the 2015\u201316 Championship season, Vokes scored his first league goal since returning from a knee injury for Burnley against former club Leeds United in a 1\u20131 draw.\r\n\r\nBorn and brought up in England, Vokes is eligible to represent Wales through a grandfather born there. Upon discovering Vokes' eligibility, Wales U21 coach Brian Flynn called him up to the Welsh under-21 team, and he made his debut against Northern Ireland on 6 February 2007. The seventeen-year-old made an instant impression by scoring after 36 seconds, a team record, in a 4\u20130 victory. He remained in the team and featured in their European U-21 Championship qualifying campaign.\r\n\r\nHe was soon called up to the senior squad and made his debut in a 1\u20130 friendly win over Iceland on 28 May 2008. Vokes scored his first senior international goal when he netted the winner in a 1\u20130 win over Azerbaijan in their opening 2010 World Cup qualifier on 6 September 2008; his second international goal came in a friendly against Montenegro on 12 August 2009. In November 2011 Vokes came on as an 85th-minute substitute and scored two goals in a 4\u20131 win over Norway. In February 2013 he scored one goal against Austria. Just over a year later he scored again in March 2014, against Iceland. On 1 July 2016, Vokes came on as a substitute and scored for Wales in a 3\u20131 win over Belgium at Euro 2016, sealing the victory to take Wales to their first ever semi-final appearance at a major tournament.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Tendayi David Darikwa (born 13 December 1991) is an English professional footballer who plays as a right back or winger for Burnley.\r\n\r\nBorn to expats Zimbabwean parents in Nottingham, he was raised in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire.\r\n\r\nDarikwa started his career at Chesterfield, signing his first professional contract in the summer of 2010, before joining Barrow on loan with fellow Chesterfield player Craig Clay in October 2010.\r\n\r\nHe made his debut for Chesterfield on 27 November 2010 in the FA Cup, in a 3\u20131 defeat by Burton Albion in the 55th minute replacing Deane Smalley.\r\n\r\nDarikwa made his league debut for Chesterfield in the 2011\u20132012 season when he started away to hometown club Notts County. He was offered a new one-year contract by the club in May 2012. Due to good league performances early in 2012\u201313 season, after the appointment of new manager Paul Cook in late October 2012, Darikwa signed a one-year contract extension until 2015. He then received national recognition by winning the Football League Young Player of the Month for December 2012 In October 2013, Darikwa was linked with a move to Premier League club Manchester United, with the then manager David Moyes scouting the player. Darikwa said he was flattered in the interest, but felt he was not ready to play at that level.\r\n\r\nOn 30 March 2014, he played at Wembley Stadium in Chesterfield's 3\u20131 defeat to Peterborough United in the final of the Football League Trophy. He also played a vital role in helping the club get promoted when they won the League Two Championship at the end of the 2013\u201314 season.\r\n\r\nAfter being converted from a right winger to a right back during the 2013\u201314 season, for the 2014\u201315 season Darikwa's squad number was changed from his usual number 7 shirt to 2 to reflect his positional change. On 7 April 2015, he scored his first goal of the 2014\u201315 season with a headed goal in a victory against Crewe Alexandra. After another impressive season in his converted right back position, Darikwa helped Chesterfield reach the League One play-offs in 2014\u201315; however they were beaten over two legs in the semi finals against Preston North End.\r\n\r\nOn 6 May 2015, Darikwa won four awards at the Chesterfield end of season awards where he won the Player Of The Year Award and Players' Player Of The Season Award.\r\n\r\nOn 30 July 2015, Darikwa signed a three-year-deal with Sky Bet Championship side Burnley F.C.. On 8 August 2015, on the opening day of the English Championship 2015/16 season, Darikwa made his debut for Burnley F.C. against Leeds United in a 1-1 draw, with Darikwa gaining an assist for Sam Vokes equalizer. On 26 September, he scored his first goal for Burnley in a 2-1 loss to Reading.\r\n\r\nDue to his Zimbabwean heritage, Darikwa is eligible to represent the Zimbabwe National side or England.\r\n\r\nIn October 2013, Darikwa revealed he was keen to play for the Zimbabwe national side but reconsidered his position after being asked to pay a 'processing fee' by a former Zimbabwe Football Association official. He did reveal he would consider any future approach from Zimbabwe or England.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Thomas David \"Tom\" Heaton (born 15 April 1986) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Burnley.\r\n\r\nHe began his professional career with Manchester United but was unable to break into the first team and spent time on loan with Swindon Town, Royal Antwerp, Cardiff City, Queens Park Rangers, Rochdale and Wycombe Wanderers, before joining Cardiff permanently after his release by Manchester United in July 2010. He then joined Bristol City on a one-year deal with an option of a second year but turned it down in May 2013 in favour of a move to Burnley, whom he has represented in the Premier League.\r\n\r\nFormerly an international from under-16 to under-21 level, Heaton has been involved in senior England squads since 2015, finally making his senior England debut against Australia on 27 May 2016 in a Euro 2016 warm up fixture.\r\n\r\nBorn in Chester, Cheshire, Heaton began his football career with Wrexham, for whom he played both in goal and in midfield, but, after making 20 appearances for the Manchester United Under-17 side in the previous two seasons, he signed for United as a trainee on 8 July 2002. He became a regular in the Under-17 side during the 2002\u201303 season, and picked up an FA Youth Cup winner's medal despite playing second fiddle to Luke Steele throughout the entire competition. He made his first appearance in the reserve team the following season, starting in a 3\u20131 home win over Birmingham City in the Premier Reserve League on 2 October 2003. At the end of the 2003\u201304 season, Heaton was named on the bench for the final of the Manchester Senior Cup against Manchester City, and won a winner's medal despite not taking the field.\r\n\r\nBy the 2004\u201305 season, Heaton had become the first-choice goalkeeper for the Manchester United reserve team, and was named on the bench for Stan Ternent's testimonial on 17 August 2004, coming on as a 76th-minute substitute for Luke Steele after Steele had earlier come on for Tim Howard. With Heaton in goal for 17 of the 28 Premier Reserve League North matches and 12 of the 22 Central League matches, the team went on to win both league titles by nine and five points respectively.\r\n\r\nHeaton's form for the reserves resulted in him being loaned out to Swindon Town at the start of the 2005\u201306, initially until 1 January 2006. During his time at Swindon, he played over 20 games, saving a penalty on his debut, and was described as \"one for the future\" by manager Iffy Onuora. He returned to Manchester United, but, after the recall of Ritchie Jones from Royal Antwerp, Heaton was sent there for the rest of the season after United rebuffed an approach from Huddersfield Town.\r\n\r\nHeaton spent the 2007\u201308 season with the first team squad at Manchester United, appearing on the bench when Edwin van der Sar was out due to injury.\r\n\r\nHeaton joined Burnley in May 2013, after turning down a further one-year deal at Bristol City. His decision was to stay in the Championship, and Burnley offered Heaton a two-year contract attaching him to the club until June 2015, with an option of a third year.\r\n\r\nOn 24 August 2013, he was the recipient of a rare technical second caution for handling the ball once releasing it in his own area whilst playing against Brighton, a game they lost 2-0.\r\n\r\nOn 30 June 2015, Heaton signed a new three-year deal at the club, therefore keeping him there until the summer of 2018. Heaton was named as captain for the 2015\u201316 season, captaining the side for the first time on 8 August 2015, on the opening day of the 2015\u201316 Football League Championship season against Leeds United in a 1\u20131 draw.\r\n\r\nHaving played for England at various youth levels, Heaton was handed his England under-21 debut in March 2008 by manager Stuart Pearce when he replaced Joe Hart as a substitute during a match against Poland. However, he did not make the final squad for the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.\r\n\r\nOn 21 May 2015, Heaton was called up to the England senior team for the first time ahead of a friendly against the Republic of Ireland and a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against Slovenia. Heaton continued to be included in Roy Hodgson's squads before finally making his debut as an 87th minute substitute in place of Fraser Forster in England's Euro 2016 warm up match against Australia at Sunderland's Stadium of Light.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Asmir Begovi\u0107 (Bosnian pronunciation:  ( listen); born 20 June 1987) is a Bosnian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for English club Chelsea and the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team, for which he is vice-captain.\r\n\r\nBegovi\u0107 started his professional career with English club Portsmouth, signing for them in the summer of 2003. After a sequence of loans, he made his Premier League debut in May 2009 and deputised for the injured David James early on in the 2009\u201310 season, before Portsmouth's financial problems led to him being sold to Stoke City for \u00a33.25 million in February 2010. He spent the remainder of the campaign as backup to veteran Thomas S\u00f8rensen, afterwards becoming first-choice goalkeeper for the rest of his time at Stoke. In the 2012\u201313 season he played in every single league match and his performances saw him win the club's Player of the Year award. In November 2013 Begovi\u0107 became the fifth goalkeeper to score a goal in the Premier League, scoring from 97.5 yards against Southampton after 13 seconds. In July 2015, he joined Premier League champions Chelsea for a fee of \u00a38 million.\r\n\r\nBegovi\u0107 represented Canada at youth level playing for them at the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup. In 2009 he decided to change his allegiance and represent his native country, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He soon established himself as their number one goalkeeper and helped them qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, their first major tournament.\r\n\r\nBegovi\u0107 was born in Trebinje, Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the time part of SFR Yugoslavia to a Bosniak family. His father, Amir, was also a goalkeeper who played for Leotar and FK Iskra Stolac whilst his mother, Ajnija, hails from Stolac. The Begovi\u0107 family fled from Bosnian War to Germany when Asmir was four years old, where he began to play organised football with local youth club FC Kirchhausen in Heilbronn. When he was 10, his family moved to Edmonton in Canada.\r\n\r\nBegovi\u0107 attended the St. Francis Xavier High School where he played for their academy. He also played Minor League Soccer with the Southwest Sting Soccer Club in Edmonton which earned him a call up to the Canada U17 squad. In 2003 he earned a trial with Portsmouth and Tottenham Hotspur and his representatives paid for him to fly over to England. After two days with Portsmouth coaches David Hurst and Mark O'Connor were suitably impressed and offered Begovi\u0107 a contract before his trial at Tottenham could begin.\r\n\r\nOn 13 July 2015, Chelsea signed Begovi\u0107 on a four-year deal for a fee of \u00a38 million. As part of the deal Chelsea also offered midfielder Marco van Ginkel in part exchange to Stoke on loan for the 2015\u201316 season.\r\n\r\nHe made his debut nine days later on Chelsea's pre-season tour, coming on at half time for Thibaut Courtois with Chelsea 1\u20130 up against the New York Red Bulls, but the match ended in a 2\u20134 defeat. Manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho defended Begovi\u0107's performance, attributing it to fatigue. His first competitive fixture was the 2015 FA Community Shield on 2 August at Wembley Stadium, in which he was unused in a 1\u20130 loss to rivals Arsenal. Six days later he came on as a substitute for Oscar when Courtois was sent off for conceding a penalty with a foul on Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis, who converted it for a 2\u20132 draw. On 16 August, Begovi\u0107 made his first competitive start for Chelsea in a 3\u20130 away loss to Manchester City. A month later, he earned the first clean sheet of the season for Chelsea in a UEFA Champions League match against Maccabi Tel Aviv which ended in a 4\u20130 win for Chelsea. He kept a sequence of three clean sheets before Courtois returned to the team on 5 December.\r\n\r\nOn 18 June 2011, Begovi\u0107 married his American-born wife, Nicolle Howard, with whom he has a daughter, Taylor. In April 2011 he joined FC Edmonton's charity 'Kicks for Kids Program'.\r\n\r\nBegovi\u0107 was born in Bosnia and Herzegovina while it was part of the SFR Yugoslavia, and moved to Germany at the age of four. Growing up in Germany, Begovi\u0107 supported Bayern Munich and cites goalkeeping great Oliver Kahn as his inspiration. He also attended matches at his local club VfB Stuttgart. Along with his native Bosnian, Begovi\u0107 is fluent in three additional languages: German, English and French. In October 2013 he set up his own charity, the Asmir Begovi\u0107 Foundation.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Eden Michael Hazard (French pronunciation: \u200b; born 7 January 1991) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays for Chelsea and the Belgium national team. He primarily plays as an attacking midfielder and as a winger. Hazard's creativity, speed, and technical ability are widely acknowledged. He has been described as \"a superb passer\" and has earned critical acclaim for his playing style, which has led to the media, coaches, and players drawing comparisons to FIFA Ballon d'Or winners Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Hazard is often ranked by coaches, colleagues, and commentators as one of the best players in the world.\r\n\r\nHazard is the son of former Belgian footballers and began his football career in Belgium playing for local clubs Royal Stade Brainois and Tubize. In 2005, he moved to France joining first division club Lille. Hazard spent two years in the club's academy and, at the age of 16, made his professional debut in November 2007. He went on to become an integral part of Lille under manager Rudi Garcia, racking up over 190 appearances. In his first full season as a starter, he won the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) Young Player of the Year award becoming the first non-French player to win the award. In the 2009\u201310 season, Hazard captured the award again becoming the first player to win the award twice. He was also named to the league's Team of the Year.\r\n\r\nIn the 2010\u201311 season, he was a part of the Lille team that won the league and cup double and, as a result of his performances, was named the UNFP Ligue 1 Player of the Year becoming the youngest player to win the award. Hazard was also given the Bravo Award by Italian magazine Guerin Sportivo for his performances during the 2010\u201311 season. In June 2012, after spending over eight years at Lille, Hazard signed for English club Chelsea, where he went on to win the UEFA Europa League in his first season and the PFA Young Player of the Year in his second. In the 2014\u201315 season, he helped Chelsea win the League Cup and Premier League, earning him the FWA Footballer of the Year and the PFA Players' Player of the Year awards.\r\n\r\nHazard is a Belgium international, having represented his nation at under-17 and under-19 level. Hazard made his senior international debut in November 2008, aged 17, in a friendly match against Luxembourg. Nearly three years after his debut, Hazard scored his first international goal against Kazakhstan in October 2011. He has since earned 70 caps, and was a member of the Belgian squad which reached the quarter-finals of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "John George Terry (born 7 December 1980) is an English professional footballer who plays for and captains Chelsea. He commonly plays as a centre back. He was also captain of the England national football team, holding the post from August 2006 to February 2010, and again from March 2011 to February 2012.\r\n\r\nA strong, tenacious, commanding and physical defender, Terry excels in the air and is known for his aggressive tackling, positioning, leadership and his ability to read the game; he is considered to be one of the best central defenders of his generation. Terry was named UEFA Club Defender of the Year in 2005, 2008 and 2009, PFA Players' Player of the Year in 2005, and was included in the FIFPro World XI for five consecutive seasons, from 2005 to 2009. He was also named in the all-star squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the only English player to make the team.\r\n\r\nTerry is Chelsea's most successful captain, having led them to four Premier League titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups and one UEFA Champions League title since 2004. He is one of five players to have made over 500 appearances for Chelsea and is also the club's all-time highest scoring defender. In 2007, he became the first captain to lift the FA Cup at the new Wembley Stadium in Chelsea's 1\u20130 win over Manchester United, and also the first player to score an international goal there, scoring a header in England's 1\u20131 draw with Brazil.\r\n\r\nBorn in Barking, east London, Terry attended Eastbury Comprehensive School and played for local Sunday League side Senrab, which also featured future Premier League players Sol Campbell, Jermain Defoe, Bobby Zamora, Ledley King and Jlloyd Samuel. As a boy, he initially was part of West Ham United's youth system, joining them as a midfielder in 1991. He moved to Chelsea at 14, playing for the club's youth and reserve teams. It was due to a shortage of central defenders that he was moved to centre-back, the position he plays today. After finishing school, he joined the club on a YTS at age 16 and signed professional terms a year later.\r\n\r\nTerry made his Chelsea debut on 28 October 1998 as a late substitute in a League Cup tie with Aston Villa; his first start came later that season in an FA Cup third round match, a 2\u20130 win over Oldham Athletic. He spent a brief period on loan with Nottingham Forest in 2000 to build up his first team experience and was the subject of interest from both Forest manager David Platt and Huddersfield Town manager Steve Bruce.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Terry was involved in an altercation with a bouncer at a West London nightclub with Chelsea teammate Jody Morris and Wimbledon's Des Byrne, which led to him being charged with assault and affray. In August 2002 Terry was acquitted of the charges in court. During the affair, he was given a temporary ban from the England national side by the FA. Previously, along with Chelsea teammates Frank Lampard, Jody Morris, Ei\u00f0ur Gu\u00f0johnsen and former teammate Frank Sinclair, in September 2001 Terry was fined two weeks wages by Chelsea after drunkenly harassing grieving American tourists in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks. During his early days at Chelsea, Terry shared a flat with Andrew Crofts.",

Kenedy has represented Brazil at under-17 and under-20 level.\r\n\r\nBorn in Santa Rita do Sapuca\u00ed, Minas Gerais, Kenedy is named after former United States Attorney General and Senator from New York, Robert Francis Kennedy. He began his career at local club Santarritense before moving to Friburguense in Rio de Janeiro state at the age of 11, going on to Vasco da Gama and Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro before arriving at Fluminense.\r\n\r\nOn 26 June 2015, Fluminense announced that Kenedy had been sold to an unnamed club for a fee around the region of \u00a36.3 million. It was later confirmed that Kenedy was on trial at Chelsea, where he played in a pre-season match against Barcelona, after Kenedy was given permission from Fluminense to play in the game as he had not yet been formally signed. Afterwards manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho stated that Chelsea could secure Kenedy a work permit to play in the Premier League rather than loan him to Vitesse Arnhem. On 22 August 2015, Chelsea completed the transfer.\r\n\r\nA week later, Kenedy made his debut against Crystal Palace, coming on as a 68th-minute substitute for C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta in a 2\u20131 home defeat. He scored his first goal for the club on 23 September in the third round of the League Cup at Walsall, also assisting compatriot Ramires in the 4\u20131 victory; his first league goal was the following 1 March, a 39th-second effort in a 2\u20131 win at Norwich City that was the fastest goal of the season.\r\n\r\nKenedy scored six goals in eight games for Brazil under-17 as they came third at the 2013 South American Championship in Argentina.\r\n\r\nKenedy originally named as part of the Brazil under-20 squad for the 2015 World Cup in New Zealand, but missed the tournament with appendicitis, being replaced by Malcom as the team ended as runners-up.",

In 2015, he signed for Leicester City for a fee of \u20ac8 million, winning the Premier League in his first season. In the summer of 2016, Kant\u00e9 signed for Chelsea.\r\n\r\nKant\u00e9 made his senior international debut for France in 2016, and was included in their squad for that year's European Championship.\r\n\r\nBorn to Malian parents, Kant\u00e9 was approached by Mali ahead of the 2015 African Cup of Nations having not played for France in any of their age group teams.

He made the most passes, the most tackles, the most interceptions, and also covered the most distance on the pitch of all the players in that match (he played every minute of it). In the 89th minute, he made a short, forward pass to Dimitri Payet, who unleashed a curling and powerful left-footed shot into the top corner from 2 metres outside the penalty box to score France's winning goal (France won the match 2\u20131).",

After further limited appearances and then a half-season loan to Premier League side Queens Park Rangers, Townsend established himself as a Tottenham player for the 2013\u201314 and 2014\u201315 seasons. He subsequently fell out of favour at Tottenham, and following a short spell at Newcastle United in the 2015\u201316 season, he transferred to Crystal Palace in the summer of 2016.\r\n\r\nIn his senior international career, Townsend earned his first England cap on 11 October 2013, and has gone on to make ten appearances, scoring three goals.\r\n\r\nTownsend joined the Tottenham Hotspur academy at the age of eight.

He is a youth international, having played for the England under-16, under-17 and under-19 teams.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2010\u201311 season, Fryers suffered a serious knee injury that kept him out for most of the season. Fryers made his senior debut for Manchester United in the League Cup on 20 September 2011, starting alongside Michael Carrick in central defence in United's third round 3\u20130 victory over rivals Leeds United. He then played in their 3\u20130 fourth round win against Aldershot Town on 25 October, appearing as a left-back. On 2 November, he was a late substitute for Jonny Evans during a 2\u20130 win against O\u021belul Gala\u021bi in a Champions League group stage match at Old Trafford. He made his Premier League debut in a game against Wolverhampton Wanderers, coming on as a substitute for Patrice Evra in the 68th minute; the game finished 4\u20131. On 26 December 2011, Fryers continued to press for more inclusions as a 46th-minute substitute for Jonny Evans in a league match against Wigan Athletic.\r\n\r\nIn February 2012, Sky Sports carried a story suggesting that Fryers could follow fellow academy product Ravel Morrison out of Old Trafford at the end of the 2011\u201312 season. On 4 July 2012, Sir Alex Ferguson stated in an interview: \"We haven't heard anything from Zeki Fryers, I don't know what's happening there but he's not been in touch with the club. His agent hasn't been in touch with the club and I can only assume he'll be back for training.\"\r\n\r\nOn 1 September 2014, Fryers signed a three-year deal with Crystal Palace for an undisclosed fee.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Jeffrey \"Jeff\" Schlupp (German pronunciation: ; born 23 December 1992) is a professional footballer who plays for English club Crystal Palace and the Ghana national team as a left back or winger. He started his career as a striker.\r\n\r\nSchlupp is known for his extreme pace and athleticism, which allows him to be a versatile option and able to play anywhere on the left wing. Former teammate Andrej Kramaric once stated that \"I've never played with a more powerful player than Jeffrey Schlupp, such power and speed like I've never seen before.\"\r\n\r\nSchlupp was part of the Leicester team that shocked the footballing world, by winning the 2015-16 Premier League as rank outsiders with the odds of 5000-1.\r\n\r\nJeff Schlupp was born to Ghanaian parents in Hamburg, Germany on 23 December 1992, and raised mostly in England after his family moved there when he was young. He attended Oakgrove School in Milton Keynes along with Oxford United goalkeeper Max Crocombe.\r\n\r\nA product of the Leicester City youth academy, Schlupp was given a squad number, 31, for the first time for the 2010\u201311 season along with fellow academy players Tom Parkes and Jorrin John by then manager Paulo Sousa. Schlupp signed a new contract keeping him at the club until 2013 on 14 March 2011. Schlupp was named amongst the Leicester City substitutes for the first time by, then manager, Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson in the 3\u20132 home defeat to Norwich City on 8 March 2011.\r\n\r\nSchlupp was called up to a Germany under-19 training camp in early 2011, but did not earn a cap in Ralf Minge's side.\r\n\r\nOn 7 November 2011 Schlupp was called up to the Ghana squad to face Sierra Leone and Gabon. Schlupp made his Ghana debut against Gabon on 15 November, coming on as a late substitute for Prince Tagoe. In April 2014, it was reported that The Black Star's coaching team are believed to have watched Schlupp play with a view to taking him to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil following a string of impressive performances for Leicester. Schlupp played in a friendly against Netherlands on 31 May but wasn't named in Ghana's final 23. Schlupp was recalled to the Ghana squad for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Uganda and Togo in September 2014. Schlupp earned his fourth cap as a late substitute in Ghana's 3\u20131 win against Togo in the Blackstars last African Cup of Nations qualifier on 19 November 2014. Schlupp returned to the Black Stars squad in March 2015, coming on as a second-half substitute in the 2\u20131 defeat to Senegal on 28 March and playing the full 90 minutes in a 1\u20131 draw with Mali on March 31.\r\n\r\nSchlupp scored his first goal for Ghana in a 7\u20131 win over Mauritius in an African Cup of Nations qualifier on 14 June 2015.\r\n\r\nSchlupp became a father in January 2014 to a son, Arlo.",

He has played over 380 matches across all competitions for his current club.\r\n\r\nSperoni was born in Buenos Aires. He started his career with Club Atl\u00e9tico Platense, in his homeland, but moved after just one year as a professional and two matches, to Scottish side Dundee. Dundee manager Ivano Bonetti received advice from an Italian contact to Speroni's potential. The move to Dundee was delayed for two months, due to administration delays in Argentina, holding up Speroni's application for an Italian passport.\r\n\r\nHe signed for Crystal Palace, newly promoted to the Premier League, on 13 July 2004, for a fee of around \u00a3750,000. On his home debut for Palace, against Everton, his erratic play would lead to him coming a cropper when, with Palace a goal up, he failed to wrong-foot Kevin Campbell while dithering on the ball when a simple clearance from a backpass was expected to be made, and having brought down the veteran striker, Thomas Gravesen converted the resulting penalty and Palace went on to lose by three goals to one. Speroni only started the first six games for his newly promoted team in their Premier League campaign, before he was replaced by Hungarian international G\u00e1bor Kir\u00e1ly after some poor performances.\r\n\r\nIn November 1998, Speroni was named in the squad for a friendly against Japan U20 in Tokyo. In December 1998, he was called into the Argentina U20 pre-selection squad for the 1999 South American U-20 Championship, Argentina's under 20 team played friendlies against Hungary and Denmark. On 30 December Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman did not name him in the final squad.\r\n\r\nSperoni made one appearance for the Argentina U20 team.\r\n\r\nSperoni also holds an Italian passport, for which he qualified through his grandfather.\r\n\r\nSperoni owns a restaurant in Purley, south London that is named 'Speroni's.'\r\n\r\nSperoni is also on the board of reference for CSW, an organisation working for religious freedom through advocacy and human rights.",

He joined in the 2004 season and ever since his early debut at the age of 18 for the South Korean side FC Seoul in the 2006 season of K League, Lee has gathered much attention from domestic football fans of South Korea in general, particularly because in South Korean football, where rookies mostly make their entrance into professional clubs through draft system, dropping out of middle school to sign a contract with a top division football club was a very rare case.\r\n\r\nIn January 2009, The Times named Lee as one of the top 50 rising stars in football.\r\n\r\nLee Chung-yong's football career started at the age of 11. Although considered to have started too late by some, his enormous talent was evident and his reputation grew among the Seoul youth football development community.\r\n\r\nOn 2 February 2015, transfer deadline day, Lee signed for Premier League side Crystal Palace for an undisclosed fee with Barry Bannan going the other way on loan. Lee's contract runs to June 2018. He scored his first goal for the club against Shrewsbury Town in the League Cup on 25 August 2015. He scored his first league goal for Palace with a 30-yard volley at the 90th minute to defeat Stoke City 2-1 on 19 December 2015.\r\n\r\nLee married his middle-school girlfriend at Hotel Shilla in Seoul on 12 July 2014.\r\n\r\nLee dislikes drinking and smoking, and even refrains from drinking coffee. He spends 2\u20133 hours a day studying English and also attends English classes.",

He is known for his leadership credentials, his tireless engine, hard-working attitude,and his tackling ability. He has also been praised for his \"physical and tactical qualities\". Thus resulting in him acquiring the nickname \"The Beast\". Sakho is also known for the eccentric hairstyles he often displays while playing, and has earned the nickname Kirikou by some supporters as a result.\r\nSakho started his career at Paris FC in 1996 before moving to professional club Paris Saint-Germain in 2002. After excelling in the youth system, Sakho earned a call up the senior team by manager Paul Le Guen. In October 2007, on his league debut, he became the youngest player ever to captain a Ligue 1 club after wearing the armband in the club's 0\u20130 draw with Valenciennes. Since making his debut with the club, Sakho has become an integral part of the team earning starting berths in the first 11 under managers Paul Le Guen and Antoine Kombouar\u00e9. Sakho's playing style and ability have led to the media and former players drawing comparisons to former French international Lilian Thuram.\r\n\r\nSakho is a senior international who has previously earned caps and captained the nation at all youth levels. Before earning his first call-up to the senior team, Sakho was playing on the under-21 team serving as the captain. He earned his first call-up to the senior team in August 2010. Sakho made his senior international debut in November 2010 against England, and was part of the French squad which reached the quarter-finals of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Arouna Kon\u00e9 (born 11 November 1983) is an Ivorian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Everton and the Ivory Coast national team.\r\n\r\nAfter making a name for himself in the Eredivisie, with Roda JC and PSV, he signed with Sevilla in 2007, where he rarely appeared due to injury and loans. In 2012, he moved from Levante to the English Premier League, where he represented Wigan Athletic and Everton, winning one FA Cup with the former.\r\n\r\nKon\u00e9 appeared for the Ivory Coast at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, as well as three Africa Cup of Nations tournaments.\r\n\r\nKon\u00e9 endured a difficult start to PSV's 2007\u201308 season: due to a date mix-up, he returned late to pre-season training following a holiday in his country, thus missing out on valuable time to prepare for the new campaign. Added to this, the player was struck down with malaria at the end of July 2007, In August, it was announced that he had returned to training following his health scare, and was expected to be fit in time for the team's first league game against Heracles Almelo on the July 19; he also immediately returned to international duty.\r\n\r\nOn 8 July 2013, Everton confirmed the signing of Kon\u00e9 on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut on 17 August, coming on as an 81st-minute substitute in a 2\u20132 draw at Norwich City. In October, he suffered a knee cartilage injury and did not play again for the rest of the season. Returning on 24 December 2014, he netted his first goal for Everton against Newcastle United in the early stages of a 3\u20132 defeat. On the opening day of the 2015\u201316 Premier League season, Kon\u00e9 came off the bench to assist and score to help Everton secure a 2\u20132 draw against Watford. His performance was rewarded with a start away at Southampton, a 0\u20133 win in which the Ivorian recorded an assist. Kon\u00e9 then continued to have an impressive start to the season, excelling in Everton's 3\u20131 win over Chelsea. He scored his first Everton hat trick in their 6\u20132 victory over Sunderland on 1 November 2015.\r\n\r\nKon\u00e9 played for the Mama Ouattara-led C\u00f4te d'Ivoire under-20 team in the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship, where he starred alongside Lierse team mate Adolphe Tohoua. He scored three goals in the tournament \u2013 once against Mexico in a 2\u20131 win, and twice in the 2\u20132 draw against the Republic of Ireland \u2013 in an eventual round-of-16 exit, and the official FIFA website declared him to be a \"crucial pivot for the attacking thrust\" of the Ivorian team, and described him as a player possessing \"physical strength, aerial ability and good ball control.\"\r\n\r\nKon\u00e9 was also picked for the squad that appeared at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, a first-ever for the African nation. He replaced Abdul Kader Ke\u00efta in the 77th minute of the first game, a 1\u20132 loss against Argentina, and started in the other two \u2013 going scoreless in the process \u2013 as the national team did not make it to the knockout stages.\r\n\r\nAfter spending four years in the international wilderness due to injuries and loss of form, Kon\u00e9 was recalled to the Ivorian squad in 2012 and was named in the squad for the 2013 African Cup of Nations due to his club form at Wigan, with boss Roberto Mart\u00ednez commenting on his player's international return, \"Arouna had a long period when he wasn't involved with the national team, and that was hard because he loves representing his country. When he is happy, we are happy, and I am very pleased he is back in the Ivory Coast squad.\"\r\n\r\nKon\u00e9 is married and has two sons and three daughters. He is a Muslim, and his father died when he was nine years old.\r\n\r\nKon\u00e9 attributes his peroxide blonde hair to former basketball player Dennis Rodman, and states that his footballing heroes were Liberian legend George Weah and Brazilian superstar Ronaldo.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Gareth Barry (born 23 February 1981) is an English footballer who plays as a midfielder for Everton. Barry is the vice-captain of Everton. He has made 590 appearances in the Premier League, including 365 for Aston Villa, putting him third on the all-time appearances list, and top amongst current players.\r\n\r\nBarry moved to Aston Villa from Brighton & Hove Albion as a youngster, and spent 12 years at the club. He captained Aston Villa and is ninth in their all-time list of appearances, with 423 across all competitions. In June 2009, he joined Manchester City, where he won the FA Cup in 2011 and the Premier League title the following season. After a season on loan, he joined Everton on a three-year contract in July 2014.\r\n\r\nBarry is a former England international, having won his first full cap in 2000 and captained the side in 2010 in a friendly against Egypt. He earned 53 caps in total, scoring 3 goals, and was included in England's squads at UEFA Euro 2000 and the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\r\n\r\nBarry joined Aston Villa from Brighton and Hove Albion as a trainee in 1997 along with Michael Standing. The move was controversial as the Brighton board demanded \u00a32.5 million for the two players; the Football Association's transfer tribunal panel came up with a deal which would have seen Brighton make \u00a32.4 million in the event of Barry and Standing making international appearances for England, as well as sell-on clauses. He played his first match for Villa on 2 May 1998 against Sheffield Wednesday. Initially, he played as a central defender, on the left-hand side of a back three alongside Gareth Southgate and Ugo Ehiogu. Barry became a highly versatile player and captain first as a centre-back, then a left-back. He then moved to left-midfield, before establishing himself in the centre of midfield. Barry was part of the Villa team who lost the 2000 FA Cup Final 1\u20130 to Chelsea.\r\n\r\nOn 2 September 2013, transfer deadline day, Barry was loaned to Everton in a season-long deal. He made his debut on 15 September in a 1\u20130 home league win against Chelsea during which he made a block on Samuel Eto'o which prevented a certain goal, later being named man of the match. Later in the month Barry became the 10th player in Premier League history to make 500 career appearances in a 3\u20132 win over Newcastle United. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2\u20131 victory over Hull City on 19 October; the goal was originally awarded to Kevin Mirallas; however, the goals panel ruled that en route to the goal, Barry was deemed to have got the last touch on the ball before it beat Hull keeper Allan McGregor. He scored a long range effort in a 2\u20130 victory against Norwich City on 26 May 2014. He became a mainstay in Everton's midfield during the season and forged a partnership with James McCarthy. Barry completed the most passes of any Everton player during his spell as he helped the club amass a club record of 72 Premier League points to finish fifth. Barry was booked 10 times during the season to have the worst disciplinary record at the club.\r\n\r\nOn 8 July 2014, following his successful loan spell at Goodison Park, Barry completed a permanent move to Everton, signing a three-year deal having been released by Manchester City following the expiry of his contract. On 26 December, he was booked for a foul on Steven Nzonzi in a 0\u20131 home loss to Stoke City, making him the first player to receive 100 yellow cards in the Premier League era. Barry was sent off with two minutes remaining away to Chelsea on 11 February 2015 for a foul on Willian, causing a mel\u00e9e in which he was confronted by Branislav Ivanovi\u0107; the game was scoreless at the incident and Everton eventually lost 1\u20130.\r\n\r\nBarry was sent off in added time at the end of a 2\u20131 loss at Arsenal on 24 October 2015, receiving a second yellow card for a foul on Kieran Gibbs. Following Everton's 2\u20131 win over Manchester City in the first leg of the League Cup semi-final on 6 January 2016, manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez described Barry as \"one of the best English players ever.\"\r\n\r\nOn 12 March 2016 in a 2\u20130 win over Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-final, Barry was booked for a confrontation with Diego Costa, who was given a second yellow card for his part and sent off. Barry, who was later sent off himself, refuted suggestions that he had been bitten on the neck by his opponent.",

He made 28 league appearances for Atl\u00e9tico B during the 2009\u201310 season, before being promoted into the senior squad. Having been used sparingly in the 2011\u201312 season, he moved on loan to Rayo Vallecano in January 2012, making 13 league appearances. He was sent out on loan again in January 2013, this time to Premier League side Wigan Athletic, where he was part of the FA Cup-winning side. Having made eight league appearances for Wigan, he returned to Atl\u00e9tico at the end of the season before joining Everton in July 2013.\r\n\r\nJoel played internationally for Spain at U16, U17, U21 and U23 level, and was part of the squad that won the 2013 European Under-21 Championship.\r\n\r\nIn April 2016, Robles caused controversy by appearing to 'like' a post calling for the sacking of his manager Roberto Martinez on social media.\r\n\r\nJoel signed for fellow league club Everton on 9 July 2013, rejoining former Wigan manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez on a five-year contract for an undisclosed fee. On 26 December 2013, he played in home defeat against Sunderland. Robles came on as a 24th-minute substitute for Leon Osman, as starting goalkeeper Tim Howard had been sent off for a professional foul. Joel was unable to save the resulting penalty, however, as Everton lost the game 1\u20130. Robles then made his first Premier League start for Everton against Southampton three days later due to Howard's suspension, with Everton winning 2\u20131.\r\n\r\nOn 13 January 2015, in a penalty shootout at the end of an FA Cup third round replay at West Ham United, Joel saved from Stewart Downing. When the shootout went to sudden death, however, Joel hit the crossbar while West Ham's goalkeeper, his compatriot Adri\u00e1n, scored to eliminate Everton.\r\n\r\nJoel made his second substitute appearance in as many Boxing Days when Tim Howard was injured in a 0\u20131 defeat to Stoke City. Despite a nervy start, Joel began enjoying one of the best runs of form of his young career, including three consecutive clean sheets. He was relegated to the bench in favour of a healthy Tim Howard.\r\n\r\nOn 19 February 2016, Everton manager Roberto Martinez confirmed Joel would be the first-choice goalkeeper over Tim Howard moving forward.",

Mirallas enjoyed success during his time at Olympiacos scoring 34 goals in 52 league games, including being the league's top scorer in his second season with 20 goals in 25 games. His impressive performances attracted the services of Everton who signed him in the summer of 2012 for \u00a36 million.\r\n\r\nMirallas has over 50 caps for Belgium since his senior debut in 2007. He has represented Belgium at various youth levels and has featured for them at senior level at the 2008 Olympics and the 2014 FIFA World Cup; the latter of which he helped his team reach the quarter-finals.\r\n\r\nMirallas spent his youth career playing for his hometown club Standard Li\u00e8ge. He then left Belgium and began his first team career in France by signing for Lille OSC and played for them since the opening of the 2004\u201305 season. Mirallas participated in the UEFA Cup in his first season at the club. Mirallas subsequently was transferred to AS Saint-\u00c9tienne for \u20ac4 million, and began to make a name for himself by scoring against Lyon on his debut in the Rhone-Loire derby.\r\n\r\nMirallas has represented Belgium at under-17, under-19 and under-21 level, and was one of the leading figures in guiding the under-21s to the semi-finals of the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship.\r\n\r\nHe scored twice in the 2008 Summer Olympics football tournament, once against China (2\u20130 victory) and once against Italy (3\u20132 victory). He made his full international debut for the senior team in 2007 and scored his first ever international goal against Serbia in Brussels on 23 August of that year, as a Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 brace helped the Red Devils to a 3\u20132 home victory.\r\n\r\nMirallas was part of the Belgian squad which reached the quarter-finals at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, making his tournament debut in the second group match, a 1\u20130 win over Russia in the Maracan\u00e3, as a 75th-minute substitute for Dries Mertens. In a game of few opportunities, Mirallas hit the post with Belgium's first shot on target, with another substitute Divock Origi scoring the only goal two minutes from full-time.\r\n\r\nMirallas was deployed as a centre forward for Olympiakos but since his move to Everton he has been deployed mainly as a winger or a free roaming forward. He is known for his pace, close ball control, passing ability and proficiency in one-on-one situations.\r\n\r\nMirallas' father was born in Spain, although Mirallas was born in Li\u00e8ge.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Leighton John Baines /\u02c8le\u026at\u0259n \u02c8be\u026anz/ (born 11 December 1984) is an English professional footballer who plays as a left-back for Premier League club Everton and the England national team.\r\n\r\nBaines started his career with Wigan Athletic, and was part of the team that won the Second Division in the 2002\u201303 season and was a runner-up in the 2004\u201305 Championship and the 2006 League Cup Final. He joined Everton in 2007, helping them reach the 2009 FA Cup Final. He has played for England at under-21 and senior levels. Baines was included in the England squads at UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\r\n\r\nBaines made his debut for Wigan Athletic in 2002, and was a member of the team that won the Second Division in the 2002\u201303 season. He was a regular in the first team when Wigan earned promotion to the Premier League in 2004\u201305. That season saw Baines score his first goal for the club, a long-range shot against Ipswich Town.\r\n\r\nBaines is believed to be a pessimist and often doubts his own footballing ability. When he secured promotion with Wigan, he doubted he was good enough to play in the Premier League: \"We won promotion to the Premier League and, straight away, I was thinking, 'Where am I going to go now?' I should have been celebrating but I spent a large part of that summer worrying about what it would be like spending the next year on the bench and in the reserves.\"\r\n\r\nBaines signed a new contract with Wigan in February 2005 despite being linked to a number of Premier League clubs, including Manchester United, Arsenal and Everton, and extended his contract again after impressive displays in his first season in the Premier League. Whilst at Wigan he started in the 2006 League Cup Final defeat to Manchester United.\r\n\r\nBaines is described in his UEFA.com profile as a \"dependable left back\" who is \"best known for his set-piece expertise and penalties\". But in his early years, Baines played in midfield and attack; it was only when he started at Wigan that he began to play in the left back position. Roberto Mart\u00ednez has planned to redeploy Baines as a midfielder, in a similar change to Philipp Lahm. Baines has stated that he would be \"excited to give it a go\".\r\n\r\nBaines was born and raised in Kirkby, Merseyside. He began playing football at a local Liverpool primary school but, age 10, had trouble playing for a Sunday League team because he was shy. He has three children with his wife, Rachel. Baines is a close friend of musician Miles Kane, and is himself a keen guitarist.\r\n\r\nBaines was educated at St Joseph The Worker Catholic Primary School and All Saints' RC High School in Kirkby.\r\n\r\nIn May 2014, on the eve of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Baines suffered personal tragedy when his 81-year-old grandmother Ann Baines died after falling down the stairs in her home. He subsequently dedicated his World Cup performances to her memory.",

Two years later he joined Everton for \u00a34 million.\r\n\r\nBe\u0161i\u0107 made his full international debut in 2010, and is the youngest player ever to represent Bosnia and Herzegovina. He also played for his national team at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\r\n\r\nBorn in Berlin to Bosnian parents, Be\u0161i\u0107 joined local club Tennis Borussia Berlin at the age of 14, where he remained until he was 16, when he signed for Hamburger SV. On 4 November 2010, Be\u0161i\u0107 extended his contract with Hamburg until 1 July 2013. After being named as a substitute in several matches in the 2010\u201311 season, he received his debut in the Bundesliga against Borussia Dortmund on 12 November. Be\u0161i\u0107 came on a substitute in the 80th minute when Dortmund was already leading 2\u20130. He started his first Bundesliga game against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, and played all 90 minutes as they won 2\u20131.\r\n\r\nIn March 2012, Be\u0161i\u0107 was suspended from the first team, due to lack of discipline, Bosnian media also claimed that manager Thorsten Fink \"strangled\" Be\u0161i\u0107 and threw him out of the dressing room.\r\n\r\nBe\u0161i\u0107 claimed in an interview that he had declined an offer to play for Germany national football team at youth level, because he only wished to play for Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team. He made his debut for the Bosnia and Herzegovina under-21 team in September 2010 against Italy under-21. On 5 November 2010, he was called up to the senior team by Safet Su\u0161i\u0107 for the friendly game on 17 November 2010 with Slovakia. He made his debut in the match, thereby becoming the youngest player to ever play for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The record was previously held by Miralem Pjani\u0107.\r\n\r\nBe\u0161i\u0107 was selected for the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team to play at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, playing all three group games against Argentina, Iran and Nigeria as Bosnia were eliminated.\r\n\r\nHe was given a straight red card on 6 September 2015 in a 3\u20130 home win over Andorra in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying for throwing his chewing gum at V\u00edctor Rodr\u00edguez, who was sent off for retaliating.\r\n\r\nBe\u0161i\u0107 has many tattoos, his first being the word Bosanac (Bosnian). He also tattooed names of his parents and brother. He is a Muslim; along with international team mates Vedad Ibi\u0161evi\u0107 and Edin Vi\u0161\u0107a he visited a mosque in Cuiab\u00e1 during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. On 4 July 2013, he became the Bosnian ambassador for the Emmaus charity organisation.\r\n\r\nBe\u0161i\u0107 was described by Everton manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez as a \"very complete footballer\", who \"has got a very natural balance about knowing that he can be strong and aggressive but in the same way he's a technical player on the ball.\"",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Philip Nikodem \"Phil\" Jagielka (born 17 August 1982) is an English professional footballer who plays for Premier League club Everton and the England national team. He is a defender and serves as captain for Everton.\r\n\r\nJagielka started his career with Sheffield United in 2000, where he played mainly as a central midfielder. He helped them achieve top-flight status for the 2006\u201307 season, after which he joined Everton for a fee of \u00a34 million.\r\n\r\nAn England international with over 30 caps, Jagielka was included in the nation's squads for UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\r\n\r\nJagielka was born in Manchester, attended Knutsford Academy and played for Holy Family Football Club, a Sunday team affiliated with, although not directly linked to, the school of the same name, from the ages of eight to eleven. He played as a right winger, as he possessed great pace, and even played in games against boys of the school year older than he. However, he first impressed youth scouts whilst playing for his local team Hale Barns United in Altrincham. He predominantly played midfield during his time with the club. He also played for his school team, Moorlands Junior School, playing any position including in goal and with boys 2 school years above him. He was at the academy of Everton as a youngster and spent time training with clubs such as Stoke City, and Manchester City, before joining Sheffield United in 1998 at 15 years of age.\r\n\r\nJagielka made his way through the youth ranks at Sheffield United before making his first team debut on 5 May 2000 against Swindon Town in the final League match of the 1999\u20132000 season, whilst still a trainee. He was rewarded with a professional contract the following day and having progressed well at the start of the following season, he signed a three-year deal with the club in January 2001.\r\n\r\nHe established himself in the Sheffield United first-team in the 2002\u201303 season and started to attract the attention of other clubs, including Leeds United, who were linked with a \u00a36 million joint bid for Jagielka and United team mate Michael Brown, but Sheffield United said they would resist any attempts to sign the players.\r\n\r\nJagielka stated in April 2005 he was happy to stay at United, despite several Premier League clubs being interested in signing him. United manager Neil Warnock told West Ham United in June 2005 that Jagielka would not be sold, and in July Wigan Athletic made a \u00a34 million bid for Jagielka, after which United upped their valuation of him. By November, Jagielka had been linked with a \u00a34 million move to Bolton Wanderers, but United manager Neil Warnock said there had been no contact from Bolton.\r\n\r\nJagielka signed a new three-year deal with United in August 2006. He played as team captain in Chris Morgan's absence. Jagielka gave United their first Premiership victory since April 1994 when he hit a 91st minute half-volley against Middlesbrough for a 2\u20131 win in September 2006. Despite being recognised as one of United's key players, chairman Kevin McCabe admitted that Jagielka could be sold if the price was high enough. In a home match against Arsenal on 30 December 2006, due to a thigh injury to starting goalkeeper Paddy Kenny and with his side 1\u20130 up, Jagielka was forced to play in goal for the remainder of the match. Arsenal were kept at bay for the remaining thirty-four minutes and Jagielka's late save from Robin van Persie secured the 1\u20130 victory. His ability to deputise in goal meant that Neil Warnock was able to \u2013 and usually did \u2013 do without a substitute goalkeeper on the bench in order to give himself more tactical options (League rules then limited the number of substitutes to 5).\r\n\r\nBy the end of the 2006\u201307 season, he had made 133 consecutive league appearances for United, including every league match in the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 seasons and every minute of the 2006\u201307 season. When Sheffield United were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2006\u201307 season, Jagielka was linked with moves away from United and goalkeeper Paddy Kenny said he believed it was time Jagielka moved on. New United boss Bryan Robson urged Jagielka to wait for the outcome of the club's relegation arbitration hearing before deciding to leave the club.",

He is a left-footed player.\r\nHe started his career with local side Rupel Boom, before joining Lierse, where he earned a move to Anderlecht of the Belgian Pro League in 2006.

He also won the Belgian Ebony Shoe in 2011. In the 2011 summer transfer window, Lukaku joined Premier League club Chelsea for an undisclosed fee, signing a five-year contract with the London club. He did not appear regularly in his first season there, and spent the following two on loan at West Bromwich Albion and Everton respectively, signing permanently for the latter for a club record \u00a328 million in 2014.\r\nLukaku made his senior international debut for Belgium in 2010, and has since earned over 30 caps.

He has also played on loan for Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds United.\r\n\r\nBarkley made his full international debut in 2013 and played for England at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Managers and teammates have compared his style of play to those of Michael Ballack, Paul Gascoigne and Wayne Rooney.\r\n\r\nRoss Barkley joined Everton as an 11-year-old and played for the club's youth teams. He was named as a substitute in a first team league game in early 2010\u201311, and was expected to make his Premier League debut before his leg was broken in three places after a collision with Liverpool's Andre Wisdom during an England under-19 match in October 2010.\r\n\r\nHe recovered from his injury in time to join the first team for pre-season training before the beginning of 2011\u201312. During pre-season, Tim Cahill heralded Barkley as the most talented footballer he had worked with. He made his debut in Everton's first home game of the season, a 1\u20130 defeat to Queens Park Rangers, and was named man of the match by Radio City Sport. His early performances were highly praised, with Martin Keown predicting that \" be one of the best players we'll ever see in this country.\" He signed a new four-and-a-half-year contract in December 2011.\r\n\r\nOn 14 September 2012, Barkley joined Sheffield Wednesday on a one-month loan deal making his debut the same day in an away defeat against Brighton & Hove Albion. He scored his first goal for the club, a penalty, against Bolton Wanderers the following week. His loan was extended before he was recalled by Everton after playing thirteen games for Wednesday. He again went out on loan, this time to Leeds United for an \"initial one-month stint\", in January 2013 and made his debut for Leeds in a derby match against Barnsley.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Sam John Byrne (born 23 July 1995) is an Irish professional footballer who plays for Everton as a forward. Born in Dublin, he began his career with St. Joseph's Boys before joining Manchester United in July 2011. He has also represented the Republic of Ireland at every youth international level from under-15 to under-19. His brother is Leinster Rugby player Adam Byrne.\r\n\r\nAfter beginning his career with St. Joseph's, Byrne joined Manchester United in July 2011, entering the club's academy as a first-year scholar. He made his debut for the club's under-18 team away to Southampton on 27 August 2011, but it took three months for him to score his first goal, which came against Liverpool on 25 November 2011. He soon became a regular starter for the under-18s and went on to score four goals in 28 appearances in his first season with the club.\r\n\r\nThe 2012\u201313 season began slowly for Byrne as he scored just two goals in 11 appearances before the turn of the year; however, five goals in the second half of the season \u2013 including braces against Fulham and Southampton \u2013 earned him plaudits from coach Paul McGuinness.\r\n\r\nIn 2013\u201314, Byrne played in all six of Manchester United's UEFA Youth League group matches but was unable to get on the scoresheet as United finished bottom of Group A and were eliminated from the competition. On 31 January 2014, he was loaned to Carlisle United with team-mate Charni Ekangamene. He made his professional debut the next day, coming on as a substitute against Bristol City.\r\n\r\nOn 23 May 2014 Byrne was released by Manchester United, and joined Everton on a free transfer on 18 July.\r\n\r\nByrne has represented the Republic of Ireland at under-15, under-16, under-17 and under-19 levels.\r\n\r\nHe made his debut for the under-15s as a left-winger in a match against the Aspire Academy from Qatar on 14 December 2009. He moved up front for a second match against the Qatari side two days later and scored Ireland's only goal in a 3\u20131 defeat. He marked the last of his six appearances for the under-15s with a brace of goals in a 5\u20130 win against Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nHe made the step up to the under-16s at a tournament in Italy in October 2010, playing in all three matches against Ukraine, Italy and Denmark. His first goal for the under-16s came in the first of two fixtures against Hungary on 23 November 2010, the first in a 2\u20131 win. He missed the team's trip to Turkey in March 2011 after being selected for the under-17s' 2011 UEFA Under-17 elite round matches against Denmark, Greece and Latvia, but returned to captain the side in a double-header at home to Belgium in April 2011, his final under-16 appearances.\r\n\r\nByrne made his under-17 debut in a tournament in Hungary in August 2010, giving Ireland the lead against the host nation in the semi-finals, only for Hungary to equalise and go on to win 4\u20132 on penalties. Ireland then lost to Serbia in the third-place play-off and finished fourth in the tournament. His impressive performances in Hungary meant he was retained in the squad for the 2011 UEFA Under-17 qualifiers against Norway, Albania and group hosts Malta. He appeared as a substitute in the wins against Malta and Albania that sealed Ireland's qualification to the elite round, but despite starting against Norway, he was unable to prevent defeat and Ireland finished second in the group. After a double-header in Italy in February 2011, Byrne played in all three UEFA Under-17 elite round matches against Denmark, Greece and Latvia, only for the undefeated Irish to miss out on the finals after Denmark beat Greece with a last-minute goal.\r\n\r\nAs an early starter in the under-17s, Byrne was able to continue in the side for a second year, starting with a double-header against Serbia in September 2011. He then played in all three of Ireland's 2012 UEFA Under-17 qualifiers against Liechtenstein, Kazakhstan and the Czech Republic in October 2011, scoring a hat-trick in an 8\u20130 win against Liechtenstein. After drawing with Kazakhstan and losing to the Czech Republic, Ireland qualified for the elite round ahead of Kazakhstan on goal difference. After a training camp in Portugal in February 2012, Byrne was again selected for the under-17 squad for the elite round matches against Serbia, the Netherlands and Albania in March 2012. He started all three games, but Ireland lost all three by a one-goal margin and finished bottom of their group, bringing Byrne's under-17 career to a close.\r\n\r\nByrne was first named in the Ireland under-19s squad for their 2013 UEFA Under-19 qualifiers against Luxembourg, Macedonia and Germany in October 2012. Byrne scored in Ireland's 5\u20132 win over Luxembourg and their 2\u20132 draw with Germany, and narrowly missed scoring in their 1\u20130 win over Macedonia as the team qualified for the elite round in second place. A friendly double-header against the Czech Republic followed in February 2013; after coming on as a substitute in a 2\u20131 win on 5 February, Byrne started the second match on 7 February, scoring Ireland's equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw. He then started all three elite round matches against Switzerland, Slovakia and Serbia, scoring in the 2\u20132 draws against Switzerland and Slovakia. However, he was unable to repeat the feat against Serbia and the match finished in a goalless draw; having needed a win to qualify, Ireland ultimately finished bottom of the group and were eliminated.\r\n\r\nByrne continued in the under-19s for the 2013\u201314 season, captaining the side for a friendly against Norway on 13 August 2013, before scoring after coming off the bench against the same opposition two days later. After another friendly double-header against Slovenia in September 2013, Byrne was named in the Ireland squad for their 2014 UEFA Under-19 qualifiers against Azerbaijan, Sweden and Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 2013, only for an injury suffered while playing for the Manchester United youth team to rule him out of the entire campaign.\r\n\r\nByrne was named in the squad for the Republic of Ireland U19 team for their UEFA elite qualifiers. He scored two crucial goals to secure a 2\u20131 win against Iceland in their first game.",

He was subsequently acquired by Pe\u00f1arol, where he established himself as a regular and also gained a spot into the Under-20 Uruguayan side.\r\n\r\nHern\u00e1ndez signed for English club Hull City on 1 September 2014 for a club record \u00a310 million on a three-year contract, with the club having an option for a fourth year. Two weeks later he made his debut at the KC Stadium, and scored the first goal of a 2\u20132 draw with West Ham United. In his next home game against Manchester City on the 27th he won a penalty after being fouled in the area by Eliaquim Mangala, and scored it in an eventual 2\u20134 defeat. His next goal came when he put his team into the lead during a 2\u20132 away draw against Arsenal.\r\n\r\nHull were relegated on 24 May 2015 after a goalless draw with Manchester United on the final day of the season. During the match, H\u00e9rnandez punched United defender Phil Jones in an off the ball incident, not seen by match officials. Two days later, he was charged with violent conduct by The Football Association, and subsequently given a three-match ban.\r\n\r\nOn 16 January 2016, in a Championship match against Charlton Athletic, Hern\u00e1ndez scored his first club career hat-trick in a game that finished 6\u20130, taking his league tally to 14 goals for the season. With six goals in four games, he won January's Football League Championship Player of the Month, and his manager Steve Bruce won the equivalent. At the club's annual awards, held on 3 May 2016, Hern\u00e1ndez was named Player of the Year and Player's Player of the Year.",

Elmohamady was part of the Egyptian squads that won the 2008 and 2010 Africa Cup of Nations.\r\n\r\nBorn in Basyoun, El Gharbia, Egypt, Elmohamady started his youth career at Ghazl El-Mahalla in 2003. He started to play for the first team in 2004 at the age of 17. Two years later, he joined ENPPI.\r\n\r\nAlthough he started his career as a striker with Ghazl El Mahalla, he played as a right-sided defender after joining ENPPI. He was selected by the Egyptian national team's manager, Hassan Shehata, for his first international appearance in 2007.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, Elmohamady attracted the attention of several European clubs. However, ENPPI was reluctant to allow him to move to any of them. In summer 2007, ENPPI turned down an offer from Hertha BSC, because the German side failed to meet the Egyptian club's financial demands. The player refused another bid from Rapid Bucure\u015fti of Romania in 2007.\r\n\r\nOn 25 November 2008, Elmohamady completed a five-day trial with Premier League side Blackburn Rovers following Rovers' manager Paul Ince's request. Rovers' new manager, Sam Allardyce, sent a senior official to Egypt to initiate talks with the Egyptian club in January 2009. However, the deal fell through as Allardyce believed it would be difficult for Elmohamady to make immediate impact.\r\n\r\nElmohamady impressed Sunderland manager Steve Bruce while on trial with the Premier League side in August 2009. However, on 31 January 2010, Sunderland failed to sign him. Belgian side Club Brugge were also interested in the player and had, according to ENPPI, already made an offer. ENPPI accepted loan bids from both West Bromwich Albion and Sunderland for Elmohamady but while West Brom's offer was larger, Elmohamady chose to go to Sunderland, after being on trial.\r\n\r\nElmohamady played several times for U21 Egypt national football team, and was a participant in 2007 African Youth Championship which was held in Republic of the Congo, he was the rising star of the Egyptian team and one of the stars of the tournament despite his playing out of position as he played forward.\r\n\r\nHe made his senior international debut in August 2007 at the age of 20, in a friendly against C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in Paris and has played eight of Egypt's last nine matches before ACN 2008. He's included in the final squad of Egypt which competed in ACN 2008 in Ghana and grabbed the cup, where he played a role as a substitute. Since then, he reserved his place in the starting line up as a Right-back or Winger. He started all Egypt's six games in the second round of FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers.\r\n\r\nIn the 2009 Confederations Cup, he was sent off in Egypt's opening game against Brazil for deliberately handling L\u00facio's goal-bound effort in the last minute, in an effort to save his team losing in the last minute. This resulted in Brazil going on to score the penalty to win the game by 4\u20133.\r\n\r\nOn 1 July 2010, Elmohamady joined Sunderland after passing medicals for a season-long loan move from ENPPI for a \u00a3500,000 fee, with an option of a permanent deal for \u00a32 million next summer.\r\n\r\nElmohamady made his debut for Sunderland in their 2\u20132 draw with Birmingham City on 14 August 2010. He won Man of the Match for his performances against Arsenal and Manchester City. Due to his impressive start at Sunderland, manager Steve Bruce expressed an interest in signing Elmohamady permanently in the January transfer window.\r\n\r\nOn 11 March 2011, Sunderland announced that they have taken up the option of a \u00a32 million transfer which was included in the loan agreement, making Elmohamady's contract a permanent one on Wearside. On 9 June 2011, the permanent contract was officially confirmed by Sunderland, with Elmohamady signing a deal which will keep him at the Stadium of Light until 2014. Manager Steve Bruce added, \"Ahmed has done well in his first season with the club and has shown plenty of potential. We look forward to helping him grow as a player and I think there is much more to come from him.\"\r\n\r\nElmohamady started Sunderland's first league game of the 2011\u201312 season away to Liverpool, and provided the assist for Seb Larsson's debut goal as the Black Cats drew 1\u20131. He scored his first goal from a header for Sunderland in a 2\u20132 draw against West Bromwich Albion on 1 October 2011. Elmohamady fell out of favour following the departure of Bruce in December 2011 and made no starts under his replacement, Martin O'Neill. At the end of the 2011\u201312 season, Elmohamady had made 18 appearances in the entire season.\r\n\r\nThe traditional transliteration of Elmohamady's name is Ahmed Al-Muhammadi. However, in England, he is officially known as Elmohamady. Elmohamady is a Muslim.",

His form in his first season as a professional led to him being named SPFA Young Player of the Year and also making his international debut. He joined Hull in July 2014 for a fee of \u00a32.85 million.\r\n\r\nRobertson was born in Glasgow and started his career at Giffnock SC. He played for Celtic as a youth but was let go at under-15 level for being too small. He captained his high school \u2013 St Ninian's High School in Giffnock \u2013 where he attended from 2006 to 2012 and from there moved to Queen's Park.\r\n\r\nFocusing on his studies, Robertson was the brink of starting University at undergraduate degree level before he was called up to the first team at the beginning of the 2012-13 season after impressing at youth level for Queen's Park. He made his debut for the club in the Scottish Challenge Cup in a penalty shot out win win against Berwick Rangers. He went on to make a total of 40 appearances during the season, helping the club to a 3rd-place finish in the Scottish Third Division. His first goal for the club came in a 2\u20131 defeat to East Stirlingshire on 13 November 2012.\r\n\r\nRobertson signed for Scottish Premiership side Dundee United, along with Queen's Park teammate Aidan Connolly, on 3 June 2013. He immediately became part of manager Jackie McNamara's first team plans, making his debut for the club on the opening day of the season in a 0\u20130 draw with Partick Thistle. On 22 September 2013, Robertson scored his first goal for Dundee United in a 2\u20132 draw, against Motherwell. It was an outstanding solo effort from Robertson, surging out of his own half, before sending a low, left-foot, drive in to the goal from 22 yards. Robertson agreed a new contract with United, until May 2016. He was voted SPFL young player of the month for September 2013 and player of the month for November 2013. On 12 April 2014, Robertson played in the Scottish Cup Semi-final against Rangers at Ibrox, which United won 3\u20131.

The transfer was completed on 29 July, as Robertson signed a three-year contract with Hull. He made his competitive debut on the opening day of the season in a 1\u20130 victory away to QPR.

Scotland manager Gordon Strachan said afterwards \"Andy came on there and the first time he picked it up he drove about 30 yards. I thought 'that's fantastic'. Absolutely no grey area, I'm going to do what I do. I loved seeing that first touch.\" Robertson made his first start for the national team in a 2\u20132 draw with Nigeria on 28 May 2014.\r\n\r\nRobertson scored his first international goal in a friendly against England at Celtic Park in November 2014, scoring the only goal as Scotland were beaten 3\u20131.\r\n\r\nRobertson was selected for the under-21 team in November 2015, as the full national team did not have a fixture.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Curtis Eugene Davies (born 15 March 1985) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender for Premier League club Hull City. Davies has previously played for Luton Town, where he began his career, West Bromwich Albion, Aston Villa, Leicester City and Birmingham City. He made two appearances for the England under-21s.\r\n\r\nDavies was born in Leytonstone, London, to an English mother and a Sierra Leonean father. He started his football career with Wimbledon as a trainee at the age of 15. A year later, he was released. He wrote to every club in the local area, including Arsenal, Crystal Palace, Queens Park Rangers, Tottenham Hotspur and Millwall asking for a trial. Colchester United responded first, two weeks before any other club, and a trial was offered; after a couple of trial matches he was released. Luton Town were the next to offer him a trial. During the trial, he scored two goals in three games and was handed a scholarship straight away. He made his first-team debut in 2003.\r\n\r\nHe made six appearances in the league during the 2003\u201304 season, with the away performance at QPR particularly good. The next season Davies achieved his first promotion as he appeared in 44 league games for the Hatters, scoring his first senior goal in the title-clinching win at Wrexham. As well as winning Luton Town's Young Player of the Year award, Davies was named Football League One Player of the Year, and was selected alongside five Luton teammates in the PFA League One Team of the Year.\r\n\r\nThe next season Davies only managed six games, and one goal in his final game, at home to Millwall, before his impressive displays saw him signed by Premier League side West Bromwich Albion on 31 August 2005 for a fee of \u00a33 million.\r\n\r\nOn 25 June 2013, Davies moved to newly promoted Premier League side Hull City on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee, reported by BBC Sport as \"understood to be around \u00a32.25 million\". He made his debut on the first day of the 2013\u201314 season in a 2\u20130 loss away at Chelsea, and scored his first goal for the club on 14 September against Cardiff City, when he headed home Tom Huddlestone's precise cross from six yards. At the annual awards ceremony on 7 May 2014, at the KC Stadium, Davies was voted as the Player of the Year. On 17 May 2014 he started in the 2014 FA Cup Final against Arsenal and scored to put his side 2\u20130 up, however Hull went on to lose 3\u20132. On 16 March 2016 Davies signed a 2-year extension to his contract with the club.\r\n\r\nDavies made his England under-21 debut on 28 February 2006, against Norway U21s. He was capped three times by the England under-21s from 2006 to 2007. He was named in Fabio Capello's first provisional England squad. Davies initially expressed shock at the news of his call-up. He has since been named in other England squads but has yet to make his full debut.\r\n\r\nDavies is also eligible for the Republic of Ireland through his grandparents and it was reported that the FAI have contacted him about the possibility. He then revealed that his grandmother was born in Ireland while her English father was serving there in the army, so he has no Irish heritage. He went on to say that he would prefer to play for the country of his father, Sierra Leone, if he fails to get into the England squad.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "David John Meyler (born 29 May 1989) is an Irish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Hull City. He is the son of hurling manager John Meyler. He grew up in Rochestown Rise in Cork and, like his father, played hurling, Gaelic football and football from an early age.\r\n\r\nAfter turning professional at League of Ireland team Cork City, Meyler moved to Sunderland in the Premier League in 2010. He joined Hull in January 2013 after a short loan spell. He has been a full international for the Republic of Ireland since 2012.\r\n\r\nHe progressed through the youth team of Cork City and signed a professional contract in 2008. He made ten appearances for Cork in the League of Ireland at the age of nineteen, with his debut in a cup game against Cobh Ramblers.\r\n\r\nMeyler joined Sunderland on 25 July 2008 for an undisclosed fee believed to be around \u00a3250,000 which has risen close to \u00a3500,000 after appearances and his first Republic of Ireland senior call-up. He became their third summer signing and followed the footsteps of former Cork City teammate Roy O'Donovan by moving to the Stadium of Light. However, it was not until a year and a half after joining Sunderland that Meyler made his first professional appearance for the club, starting against Blackburn Rovers on 28 December 2009. In his third appearance for Sunderland, at Portsmouth on 9 February 2010, Meyler received a straight red card just minutes after coming on as a second-half substitute. He suffered serious cruciate ligament damage against Manchester United on 2 May 2010, that was feared would leave him sidelined for as long as 12 months. However, he made a quicker recovery than expected, making his comeback for Sunderland's Reserves against Liverpool Reserves, on 2 November 2010. Manager Steve Bruce insisted Meyler would not be rushed back to first team action. Surprisingly, he returned in an away match at Fulham, featuring for 52 minutes in a 0\u20130 draw. On 5 January 2011, Meyler pulled up suddenly and was stretchered off in Sunderland's away match at Aston Villa. It was revealed after the game by Bruce that Meyler suffered cruciate ligament damage to the same knee as before. It was later announced by Sunderland that Meyler had a scan on the knee and had torn his medial ligament. This ruled Meyler out for another 10 weeks at least rather than 6 months which was first feared. Meyler returned to the Sunderland bench for their defeat at Birmingham City on 16 April 2011.\r\n\r\nMeyler continued to be eased back to fitness by Sunderland in the 2011\u201312 season, playing in several reserve fixtures before making a cameo substitute appearance in the 2\u20132 draw with West Bromwich Albion on 1 October 2011. He also came on as a late substitute against Aston Villa and Manchester United. Meyler's first appearance under Martin O'Neill came as a 63rd-minute substitute in the 4\u20131 win at Wigan Athletic on 3 January 2012. Meyler made his first start of the season at Stoke City on 4 February, and was involved in controversy when Robert Huth received a straight red card for a challenge on him. Sunderland went on to win 1\u20130, and Stoke manager Tony Pulis was unhappy with Meyler's reaction: \"I think Robert commits himself them pulls out, and I don't think he actually touches Meyler, or whatever his name is, and I'm really disappointed at the player's reaction... I don't think Robert actually touches the lad, and the way he goes down and rolls around, for me he's done it for one reason and that was to get him sent off.\" Meyler did not start another game for the rest of the season, although he frequently appeared as a substitute.\r\n\r\nOn 8 November 2012, Meyler was reunited with former manager Steve Bruce as he went out on loan to Hull City until 1 January 2013. He made his debut from the bench as a second-half substitute for Jay Simpson in the away match at Cardiff City on 10 November 2012. He scored his first goal for the club on 8 December 2012 when he opened the scoring in the 1\u20132 win against Watford at Vicarage Road. He scored again in the following game on 15 December, completing a 2\u20130 win at home to Huddersfield Town. On 8 January 2013, Meyler was signed by Hull permanently on a three-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee.",

After success there, Jakupovi\u0107 joined FC Lokomotiv Moscow in March 2006. In September 2011, he joined Aris, and in 2012 moved to Hull.\r\n\r\nHaving played at under-21 level for both Bosnia and Switzerland, he earned his only senior cap for the latter in 2008, and was part of their squad at UEFA Euro 2008.\r\n\r\nJakupovi\u0107 was born in Prijedor, SFR Yugoslavia, present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. He moved to Switzerland at a young age due to the Bosnian War and started his professional career at Grasshopper in 2004. He then moved to FC Thun in 2005. After a successful spell at FC Thun, Jakupovi\u0107 joined FC Lokomotiv Moscow in March 2006.\r\n\r\nOn 20 March 2012, Jakupovi\u0107 joined English Championship club Hull City on trial, and after impressing in training and a friendly match Hull manager Nick Barmby expressed a desire to sign Jakupovi\u0107 on a permanent contract. Following the sacking of Nick Barmby, Jakupovi\u0107 had trials with Ipswich Town. On 9 July 2012, Jakupovi\u0107 signed for Hull City on a two-year contract, becoming Steve Bruce's first full signing as manager. He officially joined the team on their pre-season training session in Portugal. He made his debut in a 3\u20131 friendly win against North Ferriby United on 16 July 2012. His first Championship match for The Tigers came on 21 December 2012 at Derby County, when he played in a 2\u20131 victory as Hull moved into second place in the Championship table. This was followed up by three more league appearances, all of which consisted of clean sheets.\r\n\r\nIn January 2014 Jakupovi\u0107 joined Leyton Orient on loan until 8 February.

He was loaned out to Port Vale the following month, and in the 2015\u201316 season was loaned out to Scunthorpe United and Stevenage.\r\n\r\nLuer had played non-League football for Hove Rivervale, Whitehawk and Eastbourne Borough, before he was spotted playing Isthmian League football for Burgess Hill Town by Hull scout Dean White. Burgess manager Ian Chapman handed him his debut at age 17, and recommended him to his former club Brighton & Hove Albion.\r\n\r\nHe was signed by Premier League club Hull City in January 2015. Later that month he was loaned out to League One side Port Vale. He made his debut in the Football League at Vale Park on 7 February, coming on for Richard Duffy 86 minutes into a 2\u20132 draw with Bradford City. He returned to Hull after only one further substitute appearance.\r\n\r\nLuer made his debut for Hull City on the opening day of the 2015\u201316 season when he came on as a substitute for Chuba Akpom in a 2\u20130 win over Huddersfield Town at the KC Stadium. He scored his first goal for the \"Tigers\" in the League Cup on 11 August, scoring in a 2\u20132 draw with Accrington Stanley, and then went on to convert the opening penalty of Hull's subsequent penalty shoot-out victory. He scored the only goal of the following round two weeks later to take Hull through at home to Rochdale.\r\n\r\nOn 9 February 2016, Luer moved to League One side Scunthorpe United on a month-long loan spell. He made one start and three substitute appearances for the \"Iron\", before returning to Hull City despite reports that Scunthorpe manager Nick Daws was looking to extend the loan deal.\r\n\r\nOn 12 March 2016, Luer moved on a month-long loan to League Two side Stevenage. He impressed in his first five games for the club and the loan deal was extended until the end of the 2015\u201316 season.",

Born in Sheffield, he came through the youth system at Sheffield United before graduating to the first team.\r\n\r\nMaguire was born in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. After coming through the youth system at Sheffield United, and with the side struggling against relegation, he was promoted to the first team squad, making his debut after coming on as a half-time substitute and winning the man of the match award in a home game against Cardiff City in April 2011. He made four further appearances that season but could not prevent the club from slipping into League One.\r\n\r\nHaving cemented his place in the first team Maguire scored his first goal for the Blades in a 2\u20130 win at Oldham Athletic on the opening day of the 2011\u201312 League One season. Having been ever present from the start of the season Maguire was handed an extended deal in October to keep him at Bramall Lane until 2015. He continued in great form as the Blades pushed from promotion from League One and was rewarded at the end of the season when he was named as both \"Player of the Season\" and \"Young Player of the Season\" by the club. The BBC's Match of The Day magazine selected Maguire in its League One Team of The Year for 2011\u201312.\r\n\r\nMaguire went into the following season as first choice in the centre of defence and his good form continued as he scored a brace in a Football League Trophy tie in a 4\u20131 victory over Notts County at Meadow Lane on 17 October 2012. By the end of February 2013 Maguire had made his 100th start for the Blades in a 0\u20130 draw against Leyton Orient at Bramall Lane at the age of just 19.\r\n\r\nOn 21 June 2014 it was revealed that United had offered Maguire an improved contract amid interest from Hull City and Wolverhampton Wanderers in signing Maguire with United already rejecting a \u00a31 million and an improved \u00a31.5 million bid from Wolves.",

He has also represented England at U20 level. Odubajo is a product of the Leyton Orient youth system.\r\n\r\nBorn in Greenwich, London, Odubajo began his career at age 14 with local team Millwall, spending time with the club on trial, before leaving football behind following the death of his mother. He returned to Millwall following a break from the game, but failed to win a scholarship deal. Odubajo was recommend by the Lions to Leyton Orient and went on trial with the club, playing youth team matches. He was offered a scholarship by youth team manager Wayne Burnett, though the manager later changed his mind about the deal. Burnett left Orient in the summer of 2009 and Odubajo returned to the club, impressing new youth team manager Andy Edwards and finally winning a scholarship deal. He appeared for the youth team during the 2009\u201310 season, helping the team into the fourth round of the FA Youth Cup. Odubajo received his first call up to the senior squad for a League One match versus Notts County on 18 September 2010. Awarded the number 26 shirt, he remained on the bench for the 3\u20132 defeat and was an unused substitute on another nine occasions during the 2010\u201311 season. Odubajo scored three goals in 23 appearances for the Orient youth team during the 2010\u201311 season and signed a one-year professional contract with the club on 29 April 2011.\r\n\r\nAwarded the number 22 shirt, Odubajo was called into the first team squad for four of Orient's matches early in the 2011\u201312 season and made his professional debut in a Football League Trophy first round East London derby versus Dagenham & Redbridge on 7 September 2011. Beginning the match on the bench, Odubajo replaced Elliot Omozusi after 64 minutes in a match which resulted in a penalty shootout. He scored a penalty in the shootout, which Orient lost 14\u201313. Odubajo made his league debut as a 77th-minute substitute for Matthew Spring in a 3\u20131 defeat at home to Oldham Athletic on 17 September. He made four further appearances during the 2011\u201312 season and made his first start for the club in the final game of the campaign at home to Rochdale. In the match, he scored Orient's winner (his first senior goal), shooting from 25 yards in a 2\u20131 win. This strike earned him the club's Goal of the Season award. On 25 June 2012, Odubajo signed a new one-year deal with the Os.\r\n\r\nOn 7 August 2015, Odubajo joined Hull City for a fee of \u00a33.5 million, signing a three-year deal. He made his debut on 11 August 2015 in the first round of the League Cup away to Accrington Stanley in a 2\u20132 draw, that Hull won 4\u20133 on penalties. Odubajo was first choice right back throughout the 2015-16 season and Hull were promoted to the Premier League via the play offs.\r\n\r\nIn July 2016, Odubajo suffered a serious knee injury ruling him out for up to six months.",

He quickly broke into the first team, and made 88 league appearances before switching to Tottenham Hotspur in 2005. Having spent some of the 2005\u201306 season on loan to Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he made 13 league appearances, he began to break into the Tottenham team during the 2006\u201307 season, and became a regular player for the club. However, he struggled with injury problems during the 2011\u201312 season, and fell out of favour. He joined current club Hull City in August 2013, having made 144 league appearances for Tottenham.\r\n\r\nHuddlestone represented England at under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-20 levels before making his under-21 debut in 2005. He was a regular for the under-21 side between 2005 and 2009, and made 32 appearances. He made senior full England debut in 2009, and has since gone on to make three further appearances.\r\n\r\nBorn in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, Huddlestone was taken on by Nottingham Forest at an early age but was released at 12 as he was claimed to be \"not strong enough\". He joined Derby County and after progressing well, made his debut for Derby County's reserve side at the age of just 15, when he appeared as an 80th minute substitute at right wingback in a match against Coventry City.\r\n\r\nHe was given his first-team debut by George Burley at the age of 16 on the opening day of the 2003\u201304 season in a 3\u20130 home defeat to Stoke City, where he was voted Man of the Match. Though Derby struggled in Huddlestone's first full season, Huddlestone was one of Derby's few bright points, with Burley saying \"He's a terrific talent. As a young player, he (is) the best passer of a ball I (have) ever seen, and I've worked with some good young players.\" He eventually went on to appear in 43 of Derby's 46 league games that season. He enjoyed an equally successful 2004\u201305 as Derby reached the Football League Division One playoffs, where they lost to Preston North End in the semi-final. However, halfway through the season Huddlestone signed for Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur in January 2005 for a fee reported to be worth up to \u00a32.5 million, though he remained at Derby for the rest of the campaign. He left Pride Park with 95 appearances to his name.\r\n\r\nHe is known for his passing ability, which has led to comparisons with former Tottenham player Glenn Hoddle. He also has a powerful shot that has enabled him to score long-range goals from midfield.\r\n\r\nShortly after scoring a goal for Tottenham against Arsenal in April 2011, Huddlestone accepted a challenge not to cut his hair until he scored again, to raise money for charity. It took him two-and-a-half years, and 55 games, before he finally scored his next goal (in a Premier League match for Hull against Fulham on 28 December 2013), and he raised more than \u00a357,000 for Cancer Research as a result.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Ahmed Musa (born 14 October 1992) is a Nigerian professional footballer who plays as forward for Leicester City and the Nigeria national team.\r\n\r\nMusa is the first Nigerian to score more than once in a FIFA World Cup match after scoring twice against Argentina in the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\r\n\r\nMusa began his career in the GBS Football Academy.\r\n\r\nIn September, 2007, a local publication in Jos, Nigeria featured Ahmed Musa on its Undiscovered Talent column. In 2008 he was loaned to JUTH F.C. where he played 18 games, scoring four goals in his first two professional seasons for the Healers. He was subsequently loaned to Kano Pillars F.C., in the 2009\u201310 season where he set the league record scoring multiple crucial goals as Pillars finished second.\r\n\r\nMusa previously held the record for the highest goals ever scored in one season in the history of the Nigeria Premier League until November 2011 when Jude Aneke of Kaduna United F.C. set a new goals record of 20 goals.\r\n\r\nOn 8 July 2016, Musa moved to Leicester City for a club record \u00a316.6 million.\r\n\r\nIn April 2010 under Coach Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck, he was called up to join the Nigeria national football team camp prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa after helping the Nigerian team win in the 2010 WAFU Nations Cup where he scored a goal against Benin. In the same tournament against Burkina Faso, Musa's goal deep into extra-time shot Nigeria into the finals of the tournament in Abeokuta. He was however forced out of the Super Eagles' 30-man World Cup roster due to an ankle injury.\r\n\r\nOn 5 August 2010, at the age of 17, Musa made his debut for the Nigeria senior team in a qualification match for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations against Madagascar, where he came on as a substitute for John Obi Mikel in a 2\u20130 win. Musa scored his first goal for the Super Eagles in a March 2011 friendly against Kenya.\r\n\r\nIn April 2011, Ahmed Musa was included in the Nigeria national under-20 football team squad to represent the nation in the 2011 African Youth Championship qualifiers, even though VVV Venlo had declared him unavailable for the tournament due to club commitments. After some intense negotiations with the Nigerian Federation, VVV Venlo and Musa's representatives it was agreed that Musa will shuttle between the Netherlands and South Africa to participate in the tournament with the national team. After the opening game against defending champions Ghana, Musa won the most valuable player award and boarded the next flight back to the Netherlands. \r\n\r\nIn August 2011, Musa represented Nigeria U20 in the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup held in Colombia, where he scored three goals in five matches. Musa was included by FIFA in shortlist of 10 candidates for the Adidas Golden Ball, which was awarded to the most outstanding player of the FIFA U-20 World Cup.\r\n\r\nOn 7 December 2011, Ahmed Musa was one of the four nominees named for the Confederation of African Football Most Promising Talent Award, however the award went to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's Souleymane Coulibaly. \r\n\r\nMusa was called up to Nigeria's 23-man squad for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations. He scored in a 4\u20131 semi-final defeat of Mali and appeared as a substitute against Burkina Faso in the final, as the Super Eagles won their fifth continental title. Overall he appeared in five of the team's six matches. At the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, he started in all three of the team's matches as they were eliminated in the group stage.\r\n\r\nAfter appearing in all of Nigeria's qualifying matches, Musa was named in Stephen Keshi's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He scored two goals in the team's final Group F match, a 3\u20132 defeat to Argentina.",

He won the League One, Championship and Premier League in 2009, 2014 and 2016 respectively, making him the first player to win the top three divisions with the same team in the Premier League era. He is also Leicester's all-time highest scoring midfielder.\r\n\r\nBorn in England, King is a Wales international, qualifying through his grandfather. He made his international debut in 2009, and has gone on to earn over 30 caps.\r\n\r\nKing was born in Barnstaple, Devon on holiday and was brought up in Maidenhead, Berkshire. He attended Furze Platt Senior School and joined Chelsea when he was nine years old. After being released in 2004 when he was 15 years old, he joined the Leicester City youth academy.\r\n\r\nKing qualified to play for Wales through a grandfather from Wrexham. He won caps for Wales under-19 and under-21 international, receiving his first call-up on 10 October 2007. He scored his first goal in a 5\u20131 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying win over Luxembourg under-21 on 31 March 2009. He was in the squad that narrowly lost out to England in the play-offs for a spot at the 2009 European Championships.\r\n\r\nOn 22 May 2009, King received his first call-up to the senior Wales squad when he was named in manager John Toshack's squad for a friendly match against Estonia. Despite naming King in the squad, Toshack admitted that he was not yet ready for international football. He made his debut as a last-minute substitute for Ched Evans in a 1\u20130 victory. King's first international goal came on 11 August 2010 in a 5\u20131 friendly victory over Luxembourg at Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli.\r\n\r\nKing was a regular in Wales' successful UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. He was given a straight red card in the 47th minute on 13 October 2014, in a home qualifier against Cyprus, for a foul on Constantinos Makrides. However Wales won 2\u20131, the same score at the time of the red card. Manager Chris Coleman blamed the attitude of himself and his staff for aggressively rallying the team prior to King's red card.\r\n\r\nOn 31 May 2016, King was included in Wales' 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016. King made his Euro 2016 debut, coming on as a substitute in Wales' 3\u20130 victory against Russia on 20 June as Wales won Group B.",

Hamer was born in Chard, Somerset and is a Bristol City fan. His family moved to Germany at the age of 3 and, consequently, he is a fluent German speaker. However, when he was 8, his family came back to England. He attended Holyrood Community School in Chard which is near to his birthplace. His footballing ability led to a spell playing for Somerset at county level, where he was spotted by a Reading scout. He signed for Reading at the age of 15.\r\n\r\nAfter several weeks of strong speculation about Hamer's move to Leicester City, it was finally confirmed on 22 May 2014, by Hamer himself on social media. Hamer says he made the move to the newly promoted Foxes for the chance to play Premier League football.  He made his debut in a 1-0 defeat at home to Shrewsbury Town in a Capital One Cup second round tie. Following an injury to Kasper Schmeichel whilst on international duty, Hamer made his Premier League debut on 13 September, putting in a very good performance and keeping a clean sheet as Leicester secured a 1\u20130 win at Stoke City, their first victory since returning to the Premier League.\r\n\r\nHe played his second game for Leicester against Premier League champions, Manchester City in a 0-1 home defeat on 13 December. After playing 7 games for Leicester, Hamer lost his place when on 6 January 2015, Leicester signed experienced goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer from Chelsea to help cover for the injured Kasper Schmeichel.\r\n\r\nLoan to Nottingham Forest",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Christian Fuchs (German pronunciation: ; born 7 April 1986) is an Austrian professional footballer who plays as a left back for English club Leicester City.\r\n\r\nHe began his senior career as a teenager at 1. Wiener Neust\u00e4dter SC before signing his first professional contract at 17 with SV Mattersburg, challenging for the Austrian Football Bundesliga title and taking part in European competitions. In 2008, he left for Germany, signing for VfL Bochum. After a season on loan at 1. FSV Mainz 05, he signed for FC Schalke 04 in 2011, where he contested the UEFA Champions League but suffered a serious knee injury. In 2015, he signed for Leicester, winning the Premier League in his first season at the club.\r\n\r\nA full international for a decade starting from his debut in 2006, Fuchs earned 78 caps for Austria, making him their eighth-most capped player of all time. He played for the nation at UEFA Euro 2008 and UEFA Euro 2016, captaining them for the first time in 2010 and on a permanent basis from 2012.\r\n\r\nBorn in Neunkirchen, Lower Austria, and his father was an amateur goalkeeper. He began as a forward at local team SVg Pitten before moving to 1. Wiener Neust\u00e4dter SC at the age of 11. At the age of 15, while still an amateur and at mainstream school, Fuchs played for their senior team. When he was 17, he signed his first professional deal at SV Mattersburg, a team who despite coming from a town of 6,000 drew league record average crowds of 17,000, came third in the Austrian Football Bundesliga and played in European competition.\r\n\r\nPrior to UEFA Euro 2008, he joined the German side VfL Bochum. He later described it as a useful move to play regularly while attracting attention from bigger teams. In 2010, he was signed on loan by 1. FSV Mainz 05, a newly promoted team who ended the season in the top five.\r\n\r\nOn 3 June 2015, Leicester City announced the signing of Schalke 04's Christian Fuchs on a free transfer, signing a three-year deal with the Foxes effective from 1 July. In his first season, Leicester finished as champions on odds of 5,000\u20131, making Fuchs the first Austrian to receive a Premier League winners' medal since Arsenal's Alex Manninger in 1998.\r\n\r\nPrior to signing for Leicester, Fuchs had an offer to play in the United States, where his family live, but he turned it down for financial reasons. He said in March 2016 \"My intention is to play in the US. I have come  for three years. I decided that I would sign one last contract in Europe, when I left Schalke, then go to the US.\"\r\n\r\nFuchs made his debut for Austria on 23 May 2006 in a friendly match against Croatia, replacing Stefan Lexa for the final six minutes of the 1\u20134 loss at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion in Vienna.\r\n\r\nHe was part of Austria's squad as they co-hosted UEFA Euro 2008 alongside neighbours Switzerland. He made only one appearance in the group stage elimination, playing the entirety of the 1\u20130 loss to Germany in their last match of the tournament.\r\n\r\nOn 11 August 2010, in the absence of regular skipper Marc Janko, Fuchs captained his nation for the first time in a 0\u20131 friendly loss to the Swiss in Klagenfurt. That 17 November, he scored his first international goal, equalising in a 1\u20132 home friendly loss to Greece.\r\n\r\nFuchs received the armband on a permanent basis at the behest of manager Marcel Koller on 13 August 2012. He played all 10 games as they qualified for UEFA Euro 2016, the first time they did so, and featured in every minute of the group stage elimination in France. Afterwards, he retired from international play with a total of 78 caps, declaring \"I am very proud of the 10 years that I have spent with the national team. I did everything with passion and, as I said, I am very, very proud.\"",

When Pehrsson became manager he secured the transfer rights for Amartey from the day he turned 18. To help prepare Amartey for his future permanent move to Sweden in 2013 the club brought him over for shorter periods of time in both 2011 and 2012 where he got to play for the clubs U21 team.\r\n\r\nAmartey made his Svenska Cupen debut on 3 March 2013 against Ume\u00e5 FC. He then made his league debut in the 2013 Allsvenskan opening game away against Helsingborgs IF on March 31. Amartey was praised by the media for his strong start to the 2013 season, and foreign clubs like FC Schalke 04 and 1. FC Kaiserslautern started to scout him. On May 26 he scored his first ever goal for the club when he headed home the 1\u20131 equalizer in the 2013 Svenska Cupen Final which Djurg\u00e5rden eventually lost against IFK G\u00f6teborg on penalties. After his first season in the Swedish league as an eighteen-year-old Amartey was ranked as the 10th best player in the league by newspaper Expressen and 18th best by Aftonbladet. In November 2013 Amartey confirmed that he was in talks with Liverpool F.C. over a possible move to the English club.\r\n\r\nIn July 2014, Amartey moved to F.C. Copenhagen for a fee of \u20ac2.5 million, and made his Superliga-debut on 20 July in a match against Silkeborg IF.\r\n\r\nOn 22 January 2016, Amartey joined Premier League side Leicester City on a four-and-a-half-year contract for a fee around the region of up to \u00a36m.\r\n\r\nIn May 2012 Amartey made his debut for the Ghana national under-20 football team in a game against Nigeria. He was also selected to play in the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup but Djurg\u00e5rden wanted to keep him in Sweden since the tournament clashed with the 2013 Allsvenskan season. In January 2015,Daniel played in all the group matches for Ghana at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, where the Black Stars finished as runners-up.",

A product of the Manchester United academy, during his development Simpson played on loan for Sunderland, Ipswich Town and Blackburn Rovers in England, and Royal Antwerp in Belgium. He was on loan at Newcastle United for six months before signing for them on a permanent basis in January 2010, and after four years joined Queens Park Rangers on a free transfer in June 2013 for a year, before joining Leicester City the following season. Born in Eccles, Greater Manchester, Simpson played for Parkwyddn JFC in Eccles as a youth before being picked up by Manchester United. He is a product of the Manchester United youth system, having come up through the ranks into the reserve squad in 2005.\r\n\r\nSimpson made his debut against South African team Kaizer Chiefs on 18 July 2006, which the Reds won 1\u20130. Manager Alex Ferguson claimed that Simpson looked \"anything but a player making his first start for Manchester United\".\r\n\r\nOn 30 August 2014 signed a three-year contract for fellow promoted team Leicester City for an undisclosed fee. Simpson made his Leicester debut in a 2-0 defeat against Crystal Palace off the bench on 27 September 2014. However he didn't make his second appearance for the club until 7 December against Aston Villa, as he often struggled to get into the side ahead of regular right-back Ritchie De Laet. Simpson made 14 appearances overall for Leicester in the 2014-15 season.\r\n\r\nIn the 2015-16 season, under the new management of Claudio Ranieri, De Laet was again preferred ahead of Simpson to begin with. However a 5-2 defeat by Arsenal, Ranieri changed his full-backs bringing Simpson in for De Laet helping to sure up Leicester's defence, as Simpson was considered a much more defensive full-back than De Laet and \"rarely ventured forward\". Simpson became a regular for the rest of the season, though was sent-off in the return fixture against Arsenal as Leicester went down to a late 2-1 defeat, but the Foxes held on to win their first ever Premier League title.\r\n\r\nSimpson has a daughter called Skye, born six weeks prematurely in mid-2011. On 20 May 2015, Simpson was found guilty of assaulting his then-girlfriend and mother of his child Stephanie Ward on 28 December 2014. He was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. On 12 May 2016, his sentence was reviewed in light of press-intrusion into his community service, and replaced with a 22:00 to 06:00 curfew for 21 days.\r\n\r\nIn April 2011, Simpson was caught doing 48 mph in a 30 mph zone in his Audi R8, hence adding four points to his driving licence, which already had nine points on it. Facing a ban, Simpson appealed on the basis that a ban would cause him exceptional hardship.\r\n\r\nOn 3 February 2013, Simpson was found lying in the street around the area of The Rice Flamebar and Grill in Manchester City Centre. He was unconscious with blood coming from his mouth. As reported by The Sun newspaper, Simpson collapsed after being hit following an argument while queuing for food. An ambulance was called and Simpson was taken to hospital and treated for concussion.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Demarai Remelle Gray (born 28 June 1996) is an English professional footballer who plays as a winger for Premier League club Leicester City.\r\n\r\nGray came through the youth system of Birmingham City, for whom he made his Football League debut as a 17-year-old in October 2013. In two-and-a-half seasons, he made 78 appearances across all competitions, including 51 starts in the Championship, and scored 8 goals. Gray signed for Leicester City in January 2016, and was a member of their 2015\u201316 Premier League-winning squad.\r\n\r\nHe has represented England from under-18 to under-21 level.\r\n\r\nGray was born in Birmingham, where he attended Frankley High School and played for Cadbury Athletic's junior teams. He joined Birmingham City's Academy as an under-11, and took up a two-year scholarship in July 2012. In a 2013 interview, Gray assessed his strengths as \"pace, dribbling and technique\", felt he needed to \"score more goals\", described himself in three words as \"bubbly, calm and happy\", and named Nathan Redmond as the biggest influence on him since joining the club.\r\n\r\nAfter impressing Birmingham manager Lee Clark in training, he was named in the squad for the Championship match against Millwall on 1 October 2013, and made his senior debut as a 91st-minute substitute for Jesse Lingard in a 4\u20130 win. He made his first start on 2 November, in a 1\u20130 league defeat at home to Charlton Athletic. Gray signed his first professional contract, of two-and-a-half years, on 9 December. Days after his inclusion together with academy teammate Reece Brown in a \"Top 10 Football League stars of tomorrow\" feature on the FourFourTwo website, Gray scored his first senior goal. Entering the League match at home to Blackburn Rovers on 19 April 2014 as a second-half substitute with Birmingham 4\u20131 down, he received a pass from Federico Macheda and shot low into the corner to score the final goal of the game. His performance over the season earned him the Academy Player of the Season award for 2013\u201314.\r\n\r\nPremier League club Leicester City activated the release clause in Gray's contract, reported as \u00a33.7 million, and he signed a four-and-a-half-year contract on 4 January 2016. He made his debut on 10 January, away to Tottenham Hotspur in the third round of the FA Cup. He started the match, assisted a goal by Marcin Wasilewski, and \"showed glimpses of the pace that will cause Premier League defences problems\" in the 2\u20132 draw at White Hart Lane. Six days later he made his first appearance in England's top flight, as an 85th-minute substitute for Marc Albrighton in a 1\u20131 draw at Aston Villa.\r\n\r\nConsistency of team selection as Leicester maintained their position at the top of the league meant Gray's chances of first-team football were limited, but teammate Danny Simpson highlighted the contribution of the squad players. Former Sky Sports journalist Alex Dunn wrote that Gray \"proved to be incredibly adept at killing time when coming on for Leicester as a late substitute\". He made the assist for Jamie Vardy's stoppage-time goal that secured a 2\u20130 win at Sunderland, and against Swansea City, his run from deep, cross and parried shot set up a goal for Albrighton. He had made ten appearances, all as a substitute, by 2 May when Leicester were confirmed as champions.",

He played at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, where he was Algeria's joint top scorer with two goals. As of 13 July 2014, he has won 24 international caps and scored 12 goals.\r\n\r\nEarly life & career\r\nSlimani grew up in the western Algiers suburb of Ain B\u00e9nian. It was here that his football career began as a teenage amateur, playing for local fifth tier side WB Ain B\u00e9nian. He was then signed by third division JSM Ch\u00e9raga in 2008, where he spent several months in the youth team before eventually making his debut for the first team. Slimani finished his debut season at JSM with 18 goals.\r\n\r\nClub career\r\nIn May 2009, Slimani joined CR Belouizdad from JSM Ch\u00e9raga for a transfer fee of 800,000 Algerian dinars, signing a two year contract. In August, he made his official debut for the club as a starter against MC Oran in the first week of the 2009\u201310 Algerian Championnat National. He finished his first season with Belouizdad with 8 goals in 30 games.\r\n\r\nOn 17 May 2011, Slimani scored four goals in a league game against JS Kabylie, leading CR Belouizdad to an impressive 7-1 win. In July 2011, with his contract expired and several French clubs such as Nice and Le Havre showing interest in signing him, Slimani decided to sign a two year extension with CR Belouizdad.\r\n\r\nOn 6 August 2013 Slimani joined Sporting Clube de Portugal. Slimani started the 2013\u201314 season as a substitute, gaining a reputation as an impact player due to him scoring vital goals when coming off the bench. However, due to the lack of form of Fredy Montero, he became a starter and scored 4 goals in 4 matches in early March 2014 against Rio Ave, SC Braga, Vit\u00f3ria de Setubal and in 1-0 over Porto in the Drag\u00f5es vs Le\u00f5es. In December 2013 he was considered the best Algerian footballer of the year as he won the Algerian Golden Ball.",

Although Schmeichel appeared to have made the City number 1 jersey his own at the start of the 2007\u201308 season, the emergence of Joe Hart resulted in Schmeichel being loaned to Cardiff City. The signing of Republic of Ireland international Shay Given in January 2009 meant that Schmeichel fell even further down the pecking order at City, and in August 2009, he was allowed to link up with former manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson at Notts County. He spent only one season with the Magpies as, while it was a very successful one for the club and the player himself, changes to the club's financial position made his departure necessary and his contract was terminated by mutual consent. He joined Leeds United in May 2010, but again, his tenure at the club would only last one season before he was the subject of a transfer to Leicester City, where he would again work under Eriksson. Schmeichel has gone on to play over 200 official games for Leicester, winning the Championship in 2014 and the Premier League two years later.\r\n\r\nHe played 17 games for the Denmark national under-21 team. Schmeichel was called up to the Denmark national team for the first time against Iceland on 13 May 2011, and was part of their squad at UEFA Euro 2012, but did not make his senior debut until 2013.\r\n\r\nOn 27 June 2011, Schmeichel was officially confirmed as a Leicester player, signing a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee that reunited him for a second time with his former Manchester City and Notts County manager, Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson.\r\n\r\nSchmeichel signed an ambassadorial agreement with Precision Goalkeeping on 17 August 2010 which will include the release of the \"Schmeichology\" Goalkeeping Range.\r\n\r\nSchmeichel is the son of former Denmark international goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel. Kasper spent most of his childhood living in England due to his father's playing career, and speaks with a native English accent. He attended Hulme Hall school in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, Greater Manchester and he also attended Saint Julian's School in Portugal while his father played for Sporting CP in Lisbon. When Alex Bruce, son of Kasper's father's former Manchester United teammate Steve Bruce, joined Kasper at Leeds United, the move saw the two players re-unite after both had previously played football together on the streets as children after school.\r\n\r\nKasper Schmeichel has two children: a son, Max (born 2010) and a daughter, Isabella (born 2012).",

In 2005, he moved to Amica Wronki which merged with Lech Pozna\u0144 in 2006.\r\n\r\nOn 14 September 2013, Marcin Wasilewski was reported to undergo a try out with Leicester City in the English Championship, in the hope of landing a contract. On 17 September Wasilewski was confirmed as signing for The Foxes on a one-year contract. He made his debut in a League Cup third round match against Derby County on 24 September, playing the entire match as Leicester won 2\u20131. On 30 November 2013, a coach-full of Anderlecht fans travelled to Leicester's King Power Stadium to support Marcin at his new club. There were emotional scenes after Marcin played a key role in City's 3\u20130 win over Millwall. Wasilewski established himself as a first-team regular as Leicester finished the season as Championship champions and secured their return to the Premier League. On 22 May 2014, Wasilewski extended his contract by a further year.\r\n\r\nWasilewski made his Premier League debut on 1 November 2014, in the 0-1 defeat against West Bromwich Albion, during which Wasilewski appeared to elbow opposing striker, Saido Berahino, however The FA cleared the defender. On 31 January 2015, Wasilewski scored his first goal in English football, heading in a late consolation goal in Leicester's 3-1, Premier League defeat to Manchester United which was also the second goal ever to be scored in the Premier League by a Polish footballer after Robert Warzycha had scored in the competition's opening weekend 22 and a half years earlier.

He was officially called up to the under-19 team for qualification matches for the 2011 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship.

    "strDescriptionEN": "Robert Huth (German pronunciation: ; born 18 August 1984) is a German professional footballer who plays as a centre back for Leicester City.\r\n\r\nHuth was signed for Chelsea from the youth system of German club 1. FC Union Berlin in 2001 by Claudio Ranieri. He struggled to establish himself in the Chelsea first team and with the likes of John Terry, William Gallas and Ricardo Carvalho ahead of him in the pecking order at Stamford Bridge, he joined Middlesbrough in August 2006 for a fee of \u00a36 million. He spent three years at the Riverside and after the club was relegated in 2009, Huth signed for Stoke City for a then-club record fee of \u00a35 million.\r\n\r\nAfter a successful 2010\u201311 season for Huth which saw him play in the FA Cup Final, he was named as Stoke's Player of the Year. Under the management of Tony Pulis, Huth remained a vital member of the Stoke squad in 2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313. He also played regularly under Mark Hughes in 2013\u201314 before he suffered a knee injury which ruled him out nearly a year. He was unable to force his way back into the team and he joined Leicester on loan in January 2015, helping them avoid relegation from the top flight. Huth then joined Leicester permanently, helping them to win the Premier League title in 2016.\r\n\r\nHuth was also a German international, earning 19 caps and scoring two goals between 2004 and 2009. He was part of the German squad which came third at the 2006 FIFA World Cup on home soil.\r\n\r\nHuth has made the most Premier League appearances by a German player.\r\n\r\nHuth was born in Biesdorf, East Berlin, and played for local side VfB Fortuna Biesdorf and then the youth teams at 1. FC Union Berlin before joining English side Chelsea in 2001. Huth made his debut for Chelsea at the age of 17 in the last game of the 2001\u201302 season, coming on as a substitute at half-time for Jesper Gr\u00f8nkj\u00e6r in a 1\u20133 home defeat against Aston Villa. In August 2003, Reading tried to sign Huth on loan for the 2003\u201304 season, but their bid was rejected by Chelsea. He made 20 appearances during that season, stating he was happy to stay at Chelsea. In the 2004\u201305 season, injuries restricted him to 15 appearances for the Blues.\r\n\r\nWhen the 2005\u201306 season started, Huth's chances of becoming a first-choice player at Chelsea in the near future seemed limited with John Terry, William Gallas and Ricardo Carvalho ahead of him in the Chelsea squad. These were the preferred central defenders for Chelsea manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who had succeeded Ranieri in the summer of 2004. Mourinho did, however, reject a bid for Huth from German club Bayern Munich in the summer of 2005. Huth scored twice for Chelsea, with one against M\u0160K \u017dilina in a Champions League qualifier and the other against Birmingham City in the FA Cup. At the end of the 2005\u201306 season, Huth stated that he was unhappy with his lack of first team chances, prompting Middlesbrough, Wigan Athletic and Everton to submit bids for his services. He stated that he would join Middlesbrough after the 2006 FIFA World Cup after agreeing a five-year deal.\r\n\r\nOn 2 February 2015, Huth joined Leicester City on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut eight days later, playing the entirety of a 2\u20131 defeat away at Arsenal. His first goal for the club came on 11 April 2015, heading an equaliser as they came from behind to win 3\u20132 away at West Bromwich Albion. Huth's arrival at Leicester saw the Foxes embark on a run of seven victories in their final nine fixtures, which saw them retain their Premier League status. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson admitted that he would like to sign Huth on a permanent basis.\r\n\r\nHuth completed a permanent transfer to Leicester on 24 June 2015, signing a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee, reported to be \u00a33 million. The following 13 January, he scored his first goal of the season for the title-chasing Foxes, heading in Christian Fuchs' corner for the only goal of the game at Tottenham. On 6 February, he scored twice in a 3\u20131 win at title rivals Manchester City, putting Leicester six points clear at the top of the table. Leicester won the title at 5,000-1 odds, and Huth became only the seventh player to win the Premier League with two different teams.\r\n\r\nFrom a young age, Huth was already a member of the German national team. He also played at the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship. Huth was first invited on 16 August 2004 in the senior national team of Germany, when he was nominated for the friendly match at the Ernst Happel Stadium in Vienna against Austria. Two days later, he appeared as a substitute in this friendly match in the 86th minute for Andreas Hinkel.\r\n\r\nTogether with a young Per Mertesacker, he was the first-choice central defender for Germany at the 2005 Confederations Cup. On 29 June, he scored his first goal for Germany in a 4\u20133 extra-time win against Mexico during the third-place play-off.\r\n\r\nHis second goal for Germany came in a 4\u20131 defeat to Italy in a friendly game played in Florence in March 2006. During the World Cup on home soil, Huth lost his place to Christoph Metzelder as Mertesacker's first-choice partner after being blamed for some defensive errors in several pre-tournament games and only started one game, the last group stage match against Ecuador.\r\n\r\nHe was recalled to the German national team for the first time since the 2006 World Cup in a friendly against Switzerland on 20 March 2008 owing to his impressive recent club form. He was later ruled out after suffering from a foot injury. He totalled 19 games and two goals for Germany.\r\n\r\nGrowing up in Berlin, Huth decided to support Werder Bremen, as local Hertha BSC were rarely on TV. He was a ball boy at the 1997 DFB-Pokal Final at his city's Olympic Stadium.\r\n\r\nIn January 2015, the FA began an investigation into Huth after he took part in a game on Twitter in which users guessed the gender of people in sexually explicit photos. He deleted his interactions with the game and apologised. Later that month, he was fined \u00a315,000 and banned for two matches by the FA for the interactions, which were deemed \"an aggravated breach.\"",

In 2010 he moved to Hannover 96, where he made 221 professional appearances across six seasons; he did not miss a Bundesliga game in any of his five final seasons. Zieler joined Leicester City in 2016.\r\n\r\nA former German youth international, Zieler won the 2008 UEFA European Under-19 Championship. He made his senior international debut in 2011, and was part of Germany's squads which reached the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 2012 and won the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\r\n\r\nZieler was born in Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia. He began his football career with his hometown club SCB Viktoria K\u00f6ln before joining 1. FC K\u00f6ln in 2001. In July 2005, he moved to England as a trainee with Manchester United.\r\n\r\nOn 3 June 2016, Zieler returned to England, signing for champions Leicester City on a four-year deal for an undisclosed fee.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Zieler kept goal for the German under-19 side that won the 2008 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship and played with the U-20 at 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup.\r\n\r\nHe was called up to the senior squad in August 2011, at first without making an appearance.\r\n\r\nOn 11 November 2011, 22-year-old Zieler played in the senior side 3\u20133 draw against Ukraine and was the 50th debutant of the Joachim L\u00f6w-era. He conceded all three goals within 17 minutes in the first half, without having saved a single shot until half time break, but observers found that all three goals were not his fault, and in the second half he showed a couple of brilliant saves to keep the score down. He is the first keeper since 1954 to concede as many as 3 goals (or more) in a debut match for Germany.\r\n\r\nOn 28 May 2012, Zieler was named the third goalkeeper of the German squad for the 2012 European Championship, remaining as back-up as they reached the semi-finals. On 15 August 2012, he started in net in a friendly match versus Argentina and was sent off, becoming the first German goalkeeper to earn a red card since the founding of the German national team.

    "strDescriptionEN": "Shinji Okazaki (Japanese: \u5ca1\u5d0e \u614e\u53f8; born 16 April 1986) is a Japanese footballer who plays for Leicester City, and for the Japan national football team as a forward.\r\n\r\nAt club level, Okazaki is the most prolific Japanese player in Bundesliga history. Internationally, he is currently the top active Japan national team goalscorer and third all-time in team history with 49 goals.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating Takigawa Daini High School in 2004, Okazaki signed full professional terms with Shimizu S-Pulse the following year. In December 2005, he made his first J. League appearance as a substitute against Sanfrecce Hiroshima. On 15 April 2007, he scored his first professional goal against Kawasaki Frontale. Okazaki ended his first season as a first team player with three goals from 13 matches.\r\n\r\nOkazaki scored ten times in 27 matches during the 2008 J. League season and also represented S-Pulse in the J. League Cup Final, where the team lost 2\u20130 to Oita Trinita. He continued his promising goalscoring in the 2009 and 2010 seasons and, in January 2011, was signed by German side VfB Stuttgart of the Bundesliga.\r\n\r\nOn 30 January 2011, Okazaki signed a three-and-a-half year contract with Stuttgart. On 17 February 2011, clearance to play for the club was granted for Okazaki by FIFA. He made his competitive debut for VfB on the same night in a Europa League match against Benfica. On 20 February 2011, Okazaki made his Bundesliga debut for VfB against Bayer 04 Leverkusen. Okazaki scored his first goal against Hannover 96, which he scored from outside the box.\r\n\r\nOkazaki came on as a second-half substitute for Stuttgart in their first game of the 2011\u201312 Bundesliga season against FC Schalke 04. His side were up 2\u20130 and Okazaki added a goal scoring from long range in the 90th minute, sealing a 3\u20130 win. Okazaki's goal from a bicycle kick on 19 February 2012 in a Bundesliga match of VfB Stuttgart against Hannover 96 was selected Goal of the Month. After Yasuhiko Okudera in April 1978, Okazaki was the second player from Japan to win this award in Germany.\r\n\r\nOkazaki had a poor 2012\u201313 season, scoring only once in the Bundesliga. However, he scored his first goals in European competition with two goals against FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti in the Europa League.\r\n\r\nOn 26 June 2015, Okazaki moved to Premier League side Leicester City for a fee believed to be in the region of \u00a37 million, subject to obtaining a work permit. He made his debut for the club on 8 August 2015 in Leicester City's 4\u20132 opening day win against Sunderland, and scored his first goal for the club the following week in a 2\u20131 win against West Ham United. On 19 December 2015, Okazaki scored the winner in a 3\u22122 win over Everton at Goodison Park, to ensure that Leicester City topped the table at Christmas. On 10 January 2016, Okazaki scored Leicester's second goal in the FA Cup clash at White Hart Lane with Tottenham Hotspur despite drawing to a late Harry Kane penalty in the 90th minute. On 14 March 2016, Okazaki scored the winning goal for Leicester in a league fixture against Newcastle United. The goal was a spectacular overhead strike that won Leicester City the game 1\u20130 and took them five points clear at the top of the Premier League table. Okazaki went on to win the league that year after Spurs drew with Chelsea on 2 May 2016, thus becoming the second Japanese player to win the Premier League after Shinji Kagawa.\r\n\r\nAfter competing for the country's under-23 team at the 2008 Olympic Games in China, Okazaki made his full international debut for Japan against the United Arab Emirates in October 2008. On 20 January 2009, he scored his first goal for Samurai Blue in the team's opening 2011 AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Yemen.\r\n\r\nIn October 2009, Okazaki scored hat-tricks in consecutive matches as Japan beat Hong Kong and Togo 6\u20130 and 5\u20130 respectively. He was named The World's Top Goal Scorer of 2009 by the IFFHS for his 15 goals with the national team.\r\n\r\nOkazaki was included in Japan's squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup and appeared as a substitute in all four of the team's matches. He scored once in the final Group E match, a 3\u20131 defeat of Denmark, to send the Japanese into the second round.\r\n\r\nOn 8 October 2010, Okazaki scored the only goal as Japan beat Argentina 1\u20130 in friendly match to record its first ever win over the 1978 and 1986 world champions.\r\n\r\nOkazaki scored his third international hat-trick in a 5\u20130 Group B win against Saudi Arabia at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. He then scored his kick in the semi-final shootout win over South Korea and played all 120 minutes of the final as Japan beat Australia to win the trophy for a fourth time.\r\n\r\nOkazaki finished as top goalscorer in the Asian section of qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup with eight goals.\r\n\r\nOkazaki scored twice at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, against Italy and Mexico respectively. However, Japan lost all three of its matches and was eliminated at the end of the group stage.\r\n\r\nIn June 2014, Okazaki was selected in Japan's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In the team's third group match, a 4\u20131 defeat to Colombia, he scored Samurai Blue's only goal with a header in the 45th minute.\r\n\r\nOkazaki was included in Japan's squad for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup and scored in a 4\u20130 defeat of Palestine during the group stage.\r\n\r\nOkazaki is currently the top active Japan national team goalscorer and third all-time in team history with 49 international goals.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Westley Nathan \"Wes\" Morgan (born 21 January 1984) is a Jamaican professional footballer who plays as a defender for and is captain of English club Leicester City and the Jamaica national team.\r\n\r\nHe spent the majority of his career with his boyhood club, Nottingham Forest, playing 402 official games and scoring 14 goals. He was their longest-serving player when he transferred to Leicester City in January 2012. Morgan became Leicester's captain later that year, and has gone on to play nearly 200 matches in all competitions for them, captaining them to the Championship title in 2014 and the Premier League title two years later.\r\n\r\nBorn and brought up in England, Morgan chose to represent his ancestral Jamaica at international level, making his debut for them in 2013. He was part of their teams that competed in two Copa Am\u00e9rica tournaments and finished runners-up at the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\r\n\r\nMorgan was born in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire. Having been rejected by Nottingham Forest's near neighbours Notts County at the age of 15, and went to study business at South Notts College while playing semi-professionally in central midfield for Dunkirk F.C. in the Midland Football Alliance. His performances were tracked by non-league teams and Forest, who took him as an apprentice while he continued studying. There was no transfer fee, but Dunkirk received two Forest kits. Their clubhouse has his Forest and Leicester shirts on the wall.\r\n\r\nIn February 2003, with manager Paul Hart considering him close to a first-team breakthrough after his reserve performances, Morgan was loaned to Kidderminster Harriers of the Third Division. He made his professional debut on 1 March, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1\u20133 loss to Scunthorpe United at Aggborough, deflecting a 25-yard Peter Beagrie shot for the first goal. Morgan totalled five appearances for the Worcestershire side, scoring his first goal two weeks after his debut, heading to confirm a 2\u20130 victory at Cambridge United.\r\n\r\nHart wanted Morgan to lose weight before joining the first team, which became a priority as the team had lost several players after losing in the last season's play-offs. He made his debut at left back on 12 August 2003 away to Port Vale at the age of 19; after a goalless draw Forest won a penalty shootout to advance to the second round of the League Cup. Four days later he made his First Division debut in a 3\u20130 loss to Reading; Hart considered him the man of the match. On 18 October, he scored his first goal for Forest, heading Eoin Jess' cross to finish a 6\u20130 win over bottom team Wimbledon at the City Ground. He totalled 32 games across the season, also scoring an equaliser on 3 December in the home game against Ipswich Town, and was sent off twice over the campaign.\r\n\r\nOn 30 January 2012, Morgan joined East Midland rivals Leicester City for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of \u00a31 million. As a result of his performances towards the end of the 2011\u201312 season, he was awarded with the Leicester City captaincy ahead of the 2012\u201313 season. His impressive performances early on earned him a nomination for Championship Player of the Month for September.\r\n\r\nLeicester won the 2013\u201314 Football League Championship, in which he missed only one game. Afterwards, the club used a clause in his would-be expired contract to keep him for another season; he eventually signed a new three-year deal.\r\n\r\nIn the Premier League for the 2014\u201315 season, Morgan scored his first goal of the season in a 4\u20133 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on 21 March 2015, and another in 3\u20130 win over Newcastle on the 5 May. On 19 April 2015, Morgan was selected in the \"The Football Manager Team of the Decade\" at the Football League Awards.\r\n\r\nMorgan kept his place for the 2015\u201316 season, playing in every minute of all 38 Premier League matches, one of only 4 players to achieve that accolade (including teammate Kasper Schmeichel) in that season. On 3 April 2016, he scored the only goal against Southampton, despite feeling ill. On 1 May, he equalised with a header in a 1\u20131 draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford, and the next day Leicester won the title, with Morgan becoming the first Jamaican to win a Premier League medal. After captaining Leicester City to the title, Morgan was included in the Premier League PFA Team of the Year, alongside teammates Jamie Vardy, N'Golo Kant\u00e9 and Riyad Mahrez.\r\n\r\nManager Claudio Ranieri said \"Wes Morgan is Baloo off The Jungle Book. He is a big gentle bear who looks after all the lads. He does not speak so much but when he does speak, everybody listens. He is the perfect captain. I never knew anything about him before I came here. But I watched all the matches, I watched how solid, strong and intelligent he was\".\r\n\r\nOn 1 September 2013, Morgan was called up to the Jamaican squad for the first time. He made his debut in a 0\u20130 draw against Panama at the Estadio Rommel Fern\u00e1ndez in Panama City on 7 September 2013. Morgan captained the Reggae Boyz for the first time in the 3\u20131 defeat to Canada on 9 September 2014.\r\n\r\nMorgan was part of the Jamaican squad invited to the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Chile. He played every minute of their campaign, in which they were eliminated in last place in their group. Weeks later, he was again an undisputed part of their team at the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup in the United States and Canada, helping them to a first final, which was lost 3\u20131 to Mexico at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nMorgan has a child with the sister of fellow professional footballer, Leon Best.\r\n\r\nHe is a co-owner of Blue Ink, a tattoo studio in Leicester.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Adam David Lallana (born 10 May 1988) is an English professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Liverpool and the England national team.\r\nHe began his youth career with Bournemouth before transferring to Southampton in 2000, where he became a professional in 2006. After a brief loan back to Bournemouth he broke into Southampton's first team as they earned two promotions from League One to the Premier League, becoming captain in 2012. After two seasons in the top flight and an international breakthrough, he joined Liverpool for an undisclosed fee in July 2014.\r\nLallana was given his senior international debut for England in 2013 and was selected for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\r\nLallana was a member of the Bournemouth Centre of Excellence, where he was spotted by a talent scout from Southampton. He joined the Premier League club's Saints Academy as a 12-year old in 2000. Southampton paid \u00a33,000 compensation to Bournemouth with further payments of \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000 when he signed scholarship and professional contracts respectively.\r\nLallana was involved in Southampton's FA Youth Cup squads of 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306, when they reached the final and semi-final respectively.\r\nLallana joined the first team squad in July 2006, making his debut on 23 August 2006, in a 5\u20132 victory over Yeovil Town, in the League Cup. On 31 October 2006 he signed a new contract to keep him at Southampton until December 2009. On 9 October 2007 he joined Bournemouth on loan for one month. On 28 April 2008, Lallana scored his first professional goal for Southampton against West Bromwich Albion in a crucial Championship match, with a well-placed finish into the bottom left corner.\r\nHe became a regular in the first team at the start of the 2008\u201309 season. On 29 August 2008, he signed a new three-year deal with the Saints.\r\nHe finished the 2009\u201310 season with a total of twenty goals in all competitions, netting his 20th on the final day of the season against Southend United. This made him the first Southampton midfielder to score twenty goals in a season since Matthew Le Tissier's 30 in the 1994\u201395 season.\r\nOn 7 January 2011, Lallana signed a new contract with Southampton which would expire in the summer of 2015. He was named in the League One Team of the Year for the 2010\u201311 season after scoring 11 goals that season.\r\nHe then scored on the opening day of the 2011\u201312 season, a 3\u20131 victory over Leeds United at St Mary's Stadium which broke a 12-year hoodoo of Southampton not winning on the opening day and secured a record-breaking seventh consecutive league win. He then scored twice in a 5\u20132 victory at Ipswich Town. His 150th start for the club came in a 1\u20131 draw at south coast rivals Portsmouth. His tenth goal of the season came in a 4\u20130 victory over Derby County. He then grabbed a brace in a 2\u20130 victory over Barnsley. He was nominated for the Player of the Year award but lost out to teammate Rickie Lambert. Along with Lambert and Kelvin Davis, he was one of three Southampton players named in the Championship Team of the Year for the 2011\u201312 season. He scored on the final day of the campaign to finish with 13 goals, 11 of which came in the league.\r\nHe made his first Premier League appearance on the opening day of the 2012\u201313 season, setting up a goal and wearing the captain's armband in a 3\u20132 defeat against 2011\u201312 champions Manchester City. He scored his first Premier League goal in a 4\u20131 defeat away to West Ham United. His second goal of the season came on 25 November, as he opened the scoring in a 2\u20130 home win against Newcastle United. The 50th goal of his career came in a 2\u20130 victory at Reading.\r\nOn 11 April 2013, Lallana signed a new five-year contract with Southampton. In Southampton's 4\u20131 Premier League victory over Hull City on 9 November 2013, Lallana started with the ball 30 yards from goal and dribbled his way past five players into the left-hand side of the 18-yard box, before slotting it past Hull goalkeeper Steve Harper.\r\nOn 18 April 2014, he was named as one of the six players on the shortlist for the PFA Player of the Year award. On 27 April 2014, he was named alongside teammate Luke Shaw in the PFA Team of the Year. On 6 May, he was crowned as both the Southampton Players\u2019 Player and Fans\u2019 Player of the year.",

Ings has played internationally for the England under-21 national team.\r\n\r\nIngs started his career in the youth team of Southampton but was released as a schoolboy. He subsequently joined the Centre of Excellence at Bournemouth, progressing through the system to sign a two-year scholarship in the summer of 2008. He made his first professional appearance in October 2009. He signed his first professional contract in May 2009 and extended it in September of the same year, the same month in which he joined Conference South side Dorchester Town on loan for two months. He scored his first professional goal for Bournemouth in February 2011. In August 2011, he joined Football League Championship side Burnley, on a four-year contract.\r\n\r\nIngs was born in Winchester, Hampshire. He started his career with Southampton, before being released as a school boy. He subsequently signed a two-year apprentice contract with Bournemouth in May 2008, having progressed through the club's Centre of Excellence. He had also previously had experience playing for the reserve side. He made his professional debut for Bournemouth on 6 October 2009, in a 2\u20131 away defeat to Northampton Town in the Football League Trophy, replacing Jason Tindall in the second half as a substitute. His second season in the youth team was blighted by a long-term abdominal injury, which restricted his playing time. He remained with the youth team until the summer of 2010, when he signed a short-term three-month contract. He extended his contract in September 2010, until the end of the 2010\u201311 campaign.\r\n\r\nIn September 2010, he was sent on an initial one-month loan to Conference South side Dorchester Town on loan. His debut for the Magpies came on 11 September 2010, scoring the equaliser in a 2\u20131 home defeat to Ebbsfleet United. His second goal for Dorchester came on 24 September, scoring a penalty in a 4\u20131 win over Mangotsfield United in the FA Cup. On 6 October, his loan was extended for a further month. His next goal came in a 4\u20131 defeat to Havant & Waterlooville as the Magpies were knocked out of the FA Cup. On 16 October, he scored the second in a 2\u20130 league win over Lewes, after coming on as a late substitute for Giuseppe Sole. He got his fifth goal in a 2\u20131 away win over Staines Town, scoring the opener. His first goal in November came in a 2\u20131 home defeat to Maidenhead United, which ended an unbeaten run of six games. On 12 November 2010, his loan was extended for a third time for an additional month. He scored the second in a 3\u20131 win over Weston-super-Mare in the FA Trophy to help them progress to the next round. On 23 November, his spell at Dorchester was cut short as he was recalled from his loan by Bournemouth due to an injury crisis at the club.\r\n\r\nOn 30 November, he signed a new contract extension which lasted until 2012. He made his league debut and first start for Bournemouth on 28 December 2010, in a 2\u20130 away defeat to Milton Keynes Dons in League One, where he was substituted off in the first half for Steve Fletcher. He started to become a first team regular and scored his first professional goal against Swindon Town on 1 February 2011, in a 3\u20132 win at Dean Court. His form saw him rewarded with a new contract extension, lasting until 2013. On 26 February 2011, he scored a header to equalise in 2\u20131 win away at Dagenham & Redbridge in the league. On 1 April he added to his tally with a goal against Peterborough United in a 3\u20133 draw. He went through a rich vein of goalscoring from in April, scoring four goals in three games. He scored an overhead kick to equalise in the last minute against Tranmere Rovers, however, the Cherries went on to lose the game 2\u20131. He also scored in a 2\u20130 away victory over Notts County. He scored his first brace in a 2\u20132 draw with Yeovil Town, including one penalty. His final goal for Bournemouth came in the last game of the season, in the play-off semi-final defeat to Huddersfield Town, as Bournemouth were knocked out on penalties.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2011, he was linked with reported moves away from Bournemouth with Celtic, Liverpool and Newcastle United. Premier League side Fulham also had a \u00a3400,000 bid rejected by the club. In July 2011, he was rewarded with his fifth contract in twelve months, improving his deal to be one of the top earners at the club. He remained at the club through pre-season and started in the first game of the season in a 3\u20130 away defeat to Charlton Athletic. It proved to be his final appearance for the club.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Divock Okoth Origi (Kenyan English:  ( listen) oh-ree-ghee; born 18 April 1995) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Liverpool and the Belgium national team. He is the son of former Kenyan professional footballer Mike Origi.\r\n\r\nOrigi began his career at Genk before transferring to Lille, and scored on his professional debut for them in 2013. A year later, he was signed for \u00a310 million by Liverpool, who loaned him back to Lille for the 2014\u201315 Ligue 1 season.\r\n\r\nOrigi made his international debut for Belgium in 2014, and was part of their team which reached the quarter-finals of the 2014 World Cup, during which he became the youngest goalscorer in Belgian World Cup history.\r\n\r\nOrigi began his career playing football at Genk's youth academy, but signed for Lille in May 2010. He started out playing for the club's reserve team.\r\n\r\nOrigi has represented Belgium at under-15, under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-21 level. He scored ten goals while in the under-19 team, the first in a 2013 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualification match against Belarus on 12 October 2012.\r\n\r\nThe Football Kenya Federation expressed an interest in persuading Origi to play for the Kenya senior national team in the future. However, on 13 May 2014, Belgium senior national team manager Marc Wilmots announced that he would be part of the 23 to represent Belgium at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\r\n\r\nOrigi came on as a substitute for Romelu Lukaku in the 58th minute of the opening Group H game against Algeria in Belo Horizonte on 17 June. In Belgium's second match, again after coming on as a substitute for Lukaku, he scored his first senior international goal in the 88th minute of a 1\u20130 win over Russia to qualify the Red Devils for the knockout stage. In doing so, at 19 years, 2 months and 4 days, he became the youngest goalscorer of the tournament (until American winger Julian Green scored against Belgium during their round of 16 match), the youngest goalscorer in Belgian World Cup history, and the first player of Kenyan origin to score at a FIFA World Cup finals. For his performances, he was named the Young Talent of the 2014 Belgian Sportsman of the year awards.\r\n\r\nHe scored once in Belgium's successful UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, in a 6\u20130 home win over Andorra on 10 October 2014.\r\n\r\nOrigi was born in Ostend and grew up in Houthalen-Oost. He was born into a family of footballers. His father Mike played for KV Oostende (at the time Divock was born) and Racing Genk among other Belgian clubs as well as the Kenya national team. His uncle, Austin Oduor, played for Gor Mahia in the Kenyan Premier League while his other uncles Gerald and Anthony played for Tusker. His cousin Arnold currently plays for Lillestr\u00f8m in the Norwegian Tippeligaen and the Kenya national team as a goalkeeper. The Origi family is of Kenyan Luo ethnicity.\r\n\r\nOn 25 June 2014, a baby dolphin at the Boudewijn Seapark in Bruges, Belgium was baptised \"Origi\" in his honour after having scored the winning goal against Russia during their group stage match at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Emre Can (born 12 January 1994) is a German professional footballer who plays for English club Liverpool as a central midfielder. A versatile player, Can can also play as a defensive midfielder, centre-back or full-back.\r\nHe began his career at Bayern Munich, playing mostly in its reserve side before transferring to Bayer Leverkusen in 2013. A season later, he was signed by Liverpool for \u00a39.75 million.\r\nCan has represented Germany from Under-15 to Under-21 level.\r\nCan had mainly played as a midfielder for Bayern Munich II in the Regionalliga Bayern. He made his debut for Bayern's first team in the 2012 DFL-Supercup and his Bundesliga debut against 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg on 13 April 2013. His first and only league goal came on 27 April 2013 in a 1\u20130 home win over SC Freiburg.\r\nOn 2 August 2013, Can signed a four-year deal with Bayer Leverkusen which included a buy-back clause for Bayern Munich. The move was to ensure Can got first-team football under his belt before ideally being re-signed by the Bayern in the future. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge pointed out Bayern's past successes in loaning out young players for purposes of gaining experience such as first team member Toni Kroos had at Leverkusen, captain Philipp Lahm at Stuttgart and full back David Alaba at 1899 Hoffenheim. In his first and only season at Leverkusen, Can netted four goals and notched up four assists, while largely operating in a defensive capacity. Can's performances while at Leverkusen sparked interest from Liverpool, who noted Can's performances in both the Bundesliga and Champions League, the latter in which he made his debut against Manchester United at Old Trafford which ended 4\u20132 in the favour of the Manchester side.\r\nOn 5 June 2014, it was confirmed by Bayer Leverkusen that Can would join Premier League runners up, Liverpool on 1 July after the Merseyside club activated his \u00a39.75 million (\u20ac12 million) release clause. Manager Brendan Rodgers said in a press conference later in the week that Can was an \"inspirational young talent\". Many football experts have compared him to fellow German midfielders Michael Ballack and Bastian Schweinsteiger, because of his ability to attack and defend in the midfield position. The move was completed on 3 July 2014.\r\n\r\nCan was called up for a competitive Liverpool match for the first time on 17 August, an unused substitute as they began their league campaign with a 2\u20131 home win over Southampton. He made his competitive debut for Liverpool in an away defeat against Manchester City on 25 August, coming on as a substitute for Joe Allen after 75 minutes and receiving a booking in a 3\u20131 defeat. While on duty with the German under-21s, Can was injured and was sidelined up to six weeks. On 19 October, he made his first start for Liverpool in a 3\u20132 win against Queens Park Rangers. Can scored his first Liverpool goal on 8 November with a long-range shot past Thibaut Courtois to open the scoring against Chelsea, although the opponents eventually won 1\u20132.\r\nAgainst the same opponent in a League Cup semi-final defeat on 27 January 2015, Can was stamped on by Chelsea forward Diego Costa. Referee Michael Oliver did not penalise the incident, but Costa was retrospectively banned for three matches by the FA. Can was sent off for two bookings in Liverpool's 1\u20134 loss to Arsenal at Emirates Stadium on 4 April.",

The following year was a successful year for him, as Gr\u00eamio won the Rio Grande do Sul state championship (the Campeonato Ga\u00facho) for the first time since 2001, and also came third in the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A. Lucas also became the youngest player ever to receive Placar magazine's Bola de Ouro (Golden Ball), given to the best player in the Campeonato Brasileiro \u2013 an honour previously won by the likes of Zico, Falc\u00e3o, Careca, Alex, Rom\u00e1rio, Robinho, Kak\u00e1 and T\u00e9vez.\r\n\r\nHis form in 2006 led to reported interest from many major European clubs including offers from top Spanish clubs and Inter. It was Liverpool that proved most attractive to the player, however, and on 13 May 2007 the club confirmed they had signed the player from Gr\u00eamio before the start of the 2007\u201308 season. The transfer fee was in the region of \u00a36 million.",

He was voted the best newcomer of the 2015 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A, a year in which he also helped his team win the Copa do Brasil.\r\n\r\nDue to his style of play and talent, Jesus has been dubbed the \"new Neymar\" by the media. Also Ronaldo has said he reminds him of when he was young. \r\n\r\nAt international level, he was part of the Brazilian team that came runners-up at the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He is also part of the host team at the 2016 Olympics.\r\n\r\nBorn in S\u00e3o Paulo, Gabriel Jesus grew up in the neighborhood of Jardim Peri. After initially playing street football, he joined amateur clubs in the region, his last one being Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Atl\u00e9tica Anhanguera.\r\n\r\nOn 1 July 2013, Jesus signed a youth contract with Palmeiras. He was also the club's top goalscorer during the year, scoring 54 goals in 48 matches.\r\n\r\nIn January 2014, after lengthy negotiations, Jesus signed a three-year contract for inter with an additional two, with his salary to increase from R$ 15,000 to four times as much in the fifth year; the fee to buy him out from his contract increased tenfold to R$ 30 million. However, the deal changed the balance of his economic rights from 75\u201325% in favour of Palmeiras, to 70\u201330% in favour of his agents.\r\n\r\nJesus scored 37 goals in 22 games for Verd\u00e3o in the 2014 edition of the state under-17 championship, leading to offers from clubs throughout the country and abroad. He was first included in Palmeiras' squad for a senior match on 27 August 2014, remaining an unused substitute as they lost 0\u20131 at home to Clube Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro in the first leg of the last 16 of the year's Copa do Brasil. He did not make any senior appearances during the campaign, as his side was seriously threatened with relegation; this decision, took by managers Ricardo Gareca and Dorival J\u00fanior, was widely criticized by the supporters, who demanded a change for the youngster through a petition.\r\n\r\nOn 3 August 2016, Jesus signed for English club Manchester City, although returned to Palmeiras until January 2017.\r\n\r\nJesus was part of the Brazil under-20 team that finished as runners-up at the 2015 World Cup in New Zealand. He scored their first goal of the tournament in a 4\u20132 win over Nigeria in New Plymouth, and converted as they advanced past Uruguay and Portugal on penalties.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, he was chosen in Dunga's provisional 40-man squad for the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario in the United States, and was considered as a replacement for the injured Douglas Costa in the final selection but missed out through the lack of a U.S. visa. Later that year, he was one of five forwards named in the squad for the team's hosting of the Olympic tournament.\r\n\r\nJesus plays as a forward or winger and is renowned for his pace, dribbling ability, and work ethic. The former Brazil forward Ronaldo hailed him and touted him for future success with the national team.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Jes\u00fas Navas Gonz\u00e1lez (Spanish pronunciation: ; born 21 November 1985) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for English club Manchester City as a right winger. His main assets are his quick dribbling and an ability to run at opposing defenders.\r\n\r\nHe played the vast majority of his career with Sevilla, appearing in 393 official games and winning six major titles, including two UEFA Cups and two Copas del Rey. In 2013, he signed for Manchester City.\r\n\r\nA Spanish international since 2009, Navas helped his country win the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012.\r\n\r\nBorn in Los Palacios y Villafranca, Province of Seville, Navas joined Sevilla FC's youth system at age 15. In the 2003\u201304 season, he made his first-team (and La Liga) debut when he played 12 minutes in a 0\u20131 loss at RCD Espanyol on 23 November 2003, and added four more appearances before the league was over, none complete; in 2004\u201305 he was permanently promoted to the main squad, scoring two goals from 22 games and, on 3 May 2005, his link to the club was extended until 2010.\r\n\r\nIn the 2005\u201306 campaign, Navas once again impressed, being a crucial element as the Andalusians won their first UEFA Cup: he appeared in all 12 matches in the tournament, including the final against Middlesbrough. In August 2006 a deal was arranged for a transfer to Chelsea, but the player declined the move, citing possible homesickness. In the league, he was consistently listed in the best players' ranks, entering the 'Top 50' of Don Bal\u00f3n magazine each year since 2005.\r\n\r\nFor the next three years, Navas continued to be a regular for Sevilla, always being his team top assister while adding nine league goals combined. He also helped them to the 2008 edition of the Copa del Rey, and to the third place in the following season's domestic championship.\r\n\r\nNavas was everpresent in the 2009\u201310 campaign, appearing in more than 50 official games and leading the league in decisive passes (including two in the last round against UD Almer\u00eda as Sevilla edged RCD Mallorca for the final fourth place with a 3\u20132 away triumph). On 19 May 2010, he closed the scoresheet at 2\u20130 in the final of the Spanish Cup, against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.\r\n\r\nNavas' 2010\u201311 season was greatly undermined by injury, as he appeared in less than half of the matches for Sevilla. On 13 March 2011, he scored through a rare header in a 1\u20131 home draw against eventual champions FC Barcelona, for one of only two competitive goals.\r\n\r\nAfter breaking into the Sevilla first team, Navas made his debut for the Spanish under-21s, scoring in a 1\u20131 draw against France on 17 August 2004. He had been remarked as a potential star after good performances for club and country, but his anxiety problems forced him to quit international football. In August 2009, he announced his desire to overcome his condition in order to stake his claim in the squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup and made himself available for selection, stating: \"To play for your country is the greatest thing and I hope to be able to, too. I have to be calm and make my decision. I have to continue taking the right steps.\"\r\n\r\nOn 9 November 2009, Navas was called up by coach Vicente del Bosque for friendlies with Argentina and Austria. On 14 November he made his debut against the former in a 2\u20131 win in Madrid, playing the final ten minutes in the place of Andr\u00e9s Iniesta; four days later, he featured the entire second half in a final 5\u20131 win over the latter in Vienna.\r\n\r\nCalled-up for the World Cup final stages in South Africa, Navas scored his first goal as an international on 3 June 2010 in a warm-up friendly with South Korea, netting the game's only four minutes from time. In the tournament itself he appeared in three matches, including 30 minutes plus extra time in the final against the Netherlands as Spain lifted its first FIFA World Cup trophy.\r\n\r\nNavas was also selected for UEFA Euro 2012, where he appeared in several games for the eventual champions as a substitute. On 18 June 2012 he scored the game's only goal in the 87th minute of the last group stage fixture against Croatia, handing Spain the first place in Group C: he netted from point-blank range following an assist by Iniesta.\r\n\r\nPicked for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, Navas appeared in three contests from the bench. On 27 June, in the semifinals against Italy, he scored the decisive penalty in the shootout (0\u20130 after 120 minutes).\r\n\r\nNavas was one of seven players cut from Spain's final squad for the 2014 World Cup, alongside City teammate \u00c1lvaro Negredo.",

Mainly a centre-back, he can also play as a right-back.\r\n\r\nStones began his career with Barnsley, making his professional debut in the Championship in March 2012, before joining Everton for around \u00a33 million in January 2013.\r\n\r\nIn August 2016, he signed for Manchester City for an initial \u00a347.5 million with add-ons. He made his senior debut for England in 2014 and was selected for UEFA Euro 2016 but did not feature in any of England's four matches at the tournament.\r\n\r\nBorn in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, Stones came through the Barnsley youth academy to sign professional forms in December 2011. He made his professional debut in the Championship on 17 March 2012, in a 0\u20134 defeat to Reading at Oakwell, replacing Scott Wiseman after 52 minutes. He scored his only goal for Barnsley on his first start, equalising before half time in a League Cup first round match away to Rochdale on 11 August 2012, which resulted in a 4\u20133 victory after extra time. A week later, he made his first league start, in a 1\u20130 victory against Middlesbrough.\r\n\r\nOn 9 August 2016, Manchester City completed the signing of Stones for \u00a347.5 million on a six-year deal with a potential extra \u00a32.5 million in add-ons, making him the world's second most expensive defender in history, behind David Luiz. Stones was handed the number 24 jersey ahead of the 2016\u201317 season. The announcement followed shortly after the leaking of his arrival, having been included in City's Champions League play-off round squad registration list which UEFA had published on their website prior to confirmation of the move.\r\n\r\nStones was named in manager Peter Taylor's 21-man squad for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup in May 2013. He made his England U20 debut on 16 June, in a 3\u20130 win in a warm-up game against Uruguay. He made his under-21s debut against Scotland's U21s. He played the entire 90 minutes of a 6\u20130 win for England.\r\n\r\nHe was named as a standby player for England's 2014 FIFA World Cup squad, but was not included in the final squad. Stones made his England debut on 30 May in a 3\u20130 friendly win over Peru at Wembley, replacing Everton teammate Leighton Baines for the final 15 minutes, also playing the next match, a 2\u20132 draw with Ecuador. On 3 September 2014, Stones made his first England start in a friendly against Norway at Wembley Stadium. Five days later, in England's first match of UEFA Euro 2016 qualification, Stones made his competitive debut in a 2\u20130 victory away to Switzerland at St. Jakob-Park, Basel.\r\n\r\nStones was selected in Roy Hodgson's 23-man squad for Euro 2016 but did not play in the tournament.",

He has made appearances for Manchester City U-21 team, as well as the Nigeria squad that won the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup and the Nigeria U-20 team at the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup. Iheanacho was called up to the Manchester City senior squad for the 2015\u201316 season.\r\n\r\nIheanacho was born in a Town called Obogwe in Ohaji Egbema LGA of Imo state. As a youth he represented Taye Academy in Owerri. His performances for Nigeria in the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup led to interest from clubs in Europe. Teams following his progress included Arsenal, Sporting Clube de Portugal and Porto. In December 2012 Iheanacho travelled to England to discuss a move to Manchester City. He signed a pre-contract agreement with the club, stating his intent to formally sign for Manchester City on his 18th birthday in October 2014. In the interim, he returned to Nigeria. As the year drew to a close, the Confederation of African Football named him the Most Promising Talent of the Year for 2013 at the CAF Awards.\r\n\r\nIheanacho has represented Nigeria at youth levels from under-13 upwards. His first experience of a major international tournament was the 2013 African U-17 Championship in Morocco. For Iheanacho, the highlight was a hat-trick in a win against Botswana. He dedicated his goals to his mother, who died two months before the tournament. Nigeria reached the final of the competition, where they were defeated on penalties by Ivory Coast.\r\n\r\nIheanacho played a significant role in the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup, where he won the \"Golden Ball\" awarded to the player of the tournament.

    "strDescriptionEN": "Nicol\u00e1s Hern\u00e1n Gonzalo Otamendi (born 12 February 1988) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays for Spanish club Valencia CF as a central defender.\r\nIn his professional career he played mainly for V\u00e9lez Sarsfield and Porto, winning eight major titles with the second including three national championships and the 2011 Europa League.\r\nAn Argentine international since 2009, Otamendi represented the country at the 2010 World Cup.\r\nBorn in Buenos Aires, Otamendi made his Primera Divisi\u00f3n debut for Club Atl\u00e9tico V\u00e9lez Sarsfield on 10 May 2008, in a 2\u20131 home win against Rosario Central for the Clausura tournament. During manager Hugo Tocalli's spell he was only fifth-choice stopper, behind Waldo Ponce, Fernando Tobio, Marco Torsiglieri and Mariano Uglessich. However, his role in the first team changed during Ricardo Gareca's first season as head coach, the 2009 Clausura: he replaced Ponce for the third game after the Chilean was injured while playing for his national team, and eventually won a starting position alongside Sebasti\u00e1n Dom\u00ednguez, playing 17 of the 19 games in V\u00e9lez's winning campaign.\r\nOtamendi scored his first professional goal during the 2009 Apertura, in V\u00e9lez' 3\u20131 victory over Arsenal de Sarand\u00ed. During that season he also made his debuts in an international club competition, appearing in the Copa Sudamericana; in recognition of his performances throughout the year he was chosen for the South American Team of the Year, in a traditional continent-wide journalists' poll conducted by the newspaper El Pa\u00eds.\r\nOn 23 August 2010, Otamendi was transferred to Portuguese side F.C. Porto on a \u20ac4 million fee, signing a five-year contract \u2013 V\u00e9lez also retained 50% of his registration rights, with the player having a pre-set price of another \u20ac4 million to be met by Porto prior to September 2011. He netted in his first match, a 2\u20130 home victory over S.C. Olhanense, finishing his first season with 15 appearances and five goals (notably both in a 2\u20130 away win against S.C. Braga) as the northerners won the national championship.\r\nOn 6 September 2011, Porto exercised the rights to sign the remainder of Otamendi's playing rights. He played 30 official games during the season to help the club to another two major titles, notably the back-to-back domestic league.\r\nOn 5 February 2014, Otamendi was sold to Valencia CF in La Liga for \u20ac12 million, on a five-year contract starting on 1 July. He was immediately loaned to Clube Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro in Brazil.\r\nOtamendi made his debut in the Spanish top level on 23 August 2014, starting in a 1\u20131 away draw against Sevilla FC. He scored his first goal for his new club on 4 October, helping to a 3\u20131 home success over Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.\r\nOn 4 January 2015 Otamendi headed Valencia's winner in a 2\u20131 home win over Real Madrid, ending their opponents' club record 22-match unbeaten run as a result.",

Mkhitaryan is Armenia's all-time top goalscorer, scoring 19 goals in 59 international matches since his debut in January 2007, including their first hat-trick. His previous clubs include Pyunik, where he came through the youth system, Metalurh Donetsk, Shakhtar Donetsk and Borussia Dortmund.\r\n\r\nMkhitaryan has been chosen Armenian Footballer of the Year five times (every year since 2009, except 2010). In 2012 he was voted as the best Shakhtar player of 2011\u201312 season by the fans, and Ukraine Premier League MVP. In 2012, Mkhitaryan was named in UEFA's Top 100 players by UEFA European Football Yearbook 2012\u201313. Mkhitaryan was voted the CIS Footballer of the Year for 2012, making him the first Armenian footballer to be named the best player from post-Soviet countries. He received the award again for 2013. Mkhitaryan received the nickname Heno from his fans in Armenia and has been nicknamed Micki by his Borussia Dortmund fans.\r\n\r\nMkhitaryan was born on 21 January 1989 in the Armenian capital Yerevan to Marina Taschyan and Hamlet Mkhitaryan, a prominent striker of FC Ararat Yerevan during the 1980s, who died of a brain tumor at age 33 when Mkhitaryan was seven years old. His mother is the head of the national teams department in the Armenian Football Federation and his elder sister, Monica, works at UEFA's headquarters.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the Mkhitaryan family moved to France, where Hamlet Mkhitaryan played for the now defunct ASOA Valence and helped them to be promoted to the second division Ligue 2. Mkhitaryan spent his early childhood in Valence. He always wanted to become a football player and began to follow in his father's footsteps. As a child, he would watch his father play and always wanted to follow him to training. The Mkhitaryans returned to Yerevan in 1995. In the same year Mkhitaryan joined the youth system of FC Pyunik. He graduated from the Institute of Physical Culture in Armenia. He studied economics at the Yerevan branch of the St. Petersburg Institute. Upon graduation, he plans to study there as a lawyer. In 2003, Mkhitaryan, aged 14 had trials with S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil where he played alongside the likes of Hernanes and Oscar. He returned back to Pyunik in 2004, then manager Mihai Stoichi\u021b\u0103 insisted on his return to Armenia. Growing up, Mkhitaryan considered Zinedine Zidane his football idol.\r\n\r\nMkhitaryan is an attacking midfielder capable of playing second striker as well. He thrives playing just behind the strikers, where he always looks to link up with his teammates in and around the box. Tearing apart opposition defences time and time again, he makes space for the striker/wingers to exploit and create goal scoring opportunities. Mkhitaryan has been praised for his technique, movement, accurate passing, dribbling, creativity, ball control and work rate. He is equipped with a dangerous shot, trickery to beat defenders, and a superb vision to go for the pass.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2012\u201313 season, former Scottish footballer Pat Nevin said of Mkhitaryan, \"Eleven goals in eight league matches already is fantastic, but when you add that he is a midfielder, it is phenomenal. You may not have heard of him yet, even if all the scouts at the top European clubs have, but you soon will. He has pace, skill, a rocket of a shot and the ability to arrive in the box like Frank Lampard. This all singles him out as a player who must be watched or more importantly marked.\"",

He only made two league appearances for the Spanish side in between successful loan spells at Recreativo de Huelva for the 2005\u201306 season and later English Premier League club Wigan Athletic from 2006 to 2008. Wigan later signed Valencia on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee in January 2008. His performances for Wigan soon attracted attention from several high profile clubs, eventually signing for Manchester United in June 2009. Valencia has since won the 2009\u201310 Football League Cup, the 2010 FA Community Shield, the 2010\u201311 Premier League and the 2012\u201313 Premier League during his time at Manchester United, along with being voted into PFA Team of the Year in his debut season.\r\n\r\nValencia made his Ecuador debut in 2005 and scored two goals in the process.

He also scored in his first Manchester derby game.\r\n\r\nRashford scored on his England debut in May 2016, becoming the youngest English player to score in his first senior international game. He was chosen for UEFA Euro 2016.\r\n\r\nBorn in Wythenshawe, Manchester, Rashford began playing football for Fletcher Moss Rangers at the age of five and joined the academy system at Manchester United at the age of seven.\r\n\r\nRashford was named on the first-team bench for the first time on 21 November 2015 for a Premier League game against Watford, which Manchester United won 2\u20131. On 25 February 2016, Rashford was a late addition to the Manchester United starting line-up for their UEFA Europa League round of 32, second leg tie against Midtjylland after Anthony Martial was injured in the warm-up; Rashford marked his first-team debut with two goals in the second half of a 5\u20131 win. Rashford's goals made him Manchester United's youngest ever scorer in European competition, beating a record previously held by George Best. Rashford made his Premier League debut against Arsenal three days later; he again scored twice and provided the assist for the other goal in a 3\u20132 home victory, making him the third youngest scorer for United in Premier League history after Federico Macheda and Danny Welbeck. On 20 March, Rashford scored the only goal in the Manchester derby, his team's first away league win over Manchester City since 2013. Aged just 18 years and 141 days, Rashford made his mark as the youngest ever scorer in a Manchester derby in the Premier League era.\r\n\r\nOn 30 May 2016, Rashford signed a new contract with United, keeping him at the club until 2020, with an option to extend for a further year.\r\n\r\nRashford's performances in his first senior season led to calls for him to represent England at UEFA Euro 2016. Manchester United academy coach Nicky Butt dismissed these calls, calling them premature and possibly harmful for the player's development. However, on 16 May, Rashford was named in Roy Hodgson's preliminary 26-man squad for the tournament. He became part of England's Euro 2016 squad less than four months after making his Manchester United debut.\r\n\r\nOn 27 May, he started in a warm-up game against Australia at the Stadium of Light, and scored the opening goal of a 2\u20131 win after three minutes, becoming the youngest Englishman to score on his international debut, and the third youngest overall. The previous youngest scoring debutant was Tommy Lawton in 1938.",

In 2009, he joined Padova, whom he helped avoid relegation from Serie B in his only season there. He then returned to Serie A with Palermo, and one year later, Torino, where he played for four seasons. He moved to Manchester United in July 2015, winning the FA Cup in his first season with the club.\r\n\r\nDarmian made his senior debut for the Italy national team in May 2014, and represented his nation at the 2014 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016.\r\n\r\nDarmian grew up playing football in the main square in Rescaldina and was trained by his father, Giovanni, who was one of the coaches of Oratorio team, U.S. CARCOR, where players such as Marco Simone and Luigi Pogliana also played. His first real break came when he was spotted by Beniamino Abate, a former goalkeeper tasked with scouting Lombardy for young talent by Milan.\r\n\r\nAfter playing for Italy at under-17 and under-18, he was called up to the under-19 squad, led by Francesco Rocca in July 2008. At the UEFA European U-19 Championship he played in the starting lineup, always in the role of a right full-back. In 2009, he took part in the Mediterranean Games, playing seven games for the under-20 side. On 25 March 2009, he made his debut for the Italy U-21 side in a friendly match against Austria (2\u20132), played in Vienna. From 10 to 12 March 2014, he was called up to the senior national team by coach Cesare Prandelli as part of an internship to evaluate young players ahead of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, confirmed on the next meeting between 14 and 15 April.\r\n\r\nGiven his excellent season with Torino, on 13 May 2014, he was included in the list of 30 provisional players for the 2014 World Cup. He made his debut for the Azzurri on 31 May 2014, at age 24, playing as a right-back in a friendly match with Ireland (0\u20130) held in London. The following day, he was included in the list of 23 players selected for the World Cup. On 14 June, he made his debut at the World Cup, playing as a starter in Italy's opening game against England, won 2\u20131. He also played the next two games against Costa Rica and Uruguay, both lost 1\u20130 with Italy failing to qualify for the next round.\r\n\r\nIn early 2015 he was awarded with the Pallone Azzurro as the best player of the national team for 2014. On 10 October of that year, he scored his first international goal, which was the final one of a 3\u20131 away win over Azerbaijan which sealed Italy's qualification to UEFA Euro 2016. On 31 May 2016, he was named to Conte's 23-man Italy squad for Euro 2016. In the round of 16 of the tournament, at Stade de France in Paris on 27 June, he came off the bench and set-up Graziano Pell\u00e8's 91st minute volley to give the Azzurri a 2\u20130 win over defending champions Spain. On 2 July, he missed Italy's final penalty in a 6\u20135 shoot-out defeat to reigning World Cup champions Germany in the quarter-finals of the competition.",

Carrick primarily plays as a central midfielder, but he has been used as an emergency centre-back under Alex Ferguson, David Moyes and Louis van Gaal. At the time of his move to Manchester United, distinctive features of his play included his inventive distribution of the ball along with his passing and crossing abilities.\r\n\r\nCarrick began his career at West Ham United, joining the youth team in 1997 and winning the FA Youth Cup two years later. He was sent on loan twice during his debut season, to Swindon Town and Birmingham City, before securing a place in the first team by the 2000\u201301 season. He experienced relegation in the 2002\u201303 season and was voted into the PFA First Division Team of the Year in the following campaign. He made more than 150 appearances for the Hammers, but in 2004, he moved to rival London club Tottenham Hotspur for a fee believed to be \u00a33.5 million. He was ever-present during his Spurs career, scoring twice in 75 appearances, before moving to Manchester United in 2006 for \u00a318 million.\r\n\r\nFrom his debut onwards he was a regular in the Manchester United first team, making more than 50 appearances in his first season with them. He established himself as a key member of the team that won the Premier League in 2006\u201307, their first title success in four years. The following season he was part of the side that won the 2008 Champions League final, playing the full 120 minutes as they enjoyed a 6\u20135 penalty shootout win, with Carrick converting his spotkick, to help achieve the European Double. He enjoyed a third consecutive title triumph in the 2008\u201309 campaign, but couldn't prevent a Champions League final defeat to FC Barcelona. He won his first League Cup medal in 2009, however, for the first time during his Manchester United career, he missed out on another title success as they finished runners-up to Chelsea.\r\n\r\nCarrick has represented England at under-18, under-21, B and senior levels. He made his England debut in 2001 and has since gained 31 caps but has yet to score an international goal. Carrick has often been overlooked during his England career, with Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Gareth Barry and for a brief time Scott Parker preferred in his position. This was the case until the 2012-13 season, when Carrick established himself as a regular. He has been a member of the England squads for two major tournaments, the 2006 and 2010 World Cups.",

He operates primarily as a central midfielder and is comfortable playing both in attack and defence.\r\n\r\nPogba was described by his club Manchester United as a \"powerful, skilful, and creative\" player who has \"an eye for goal and a penchant for the spectacular.\" In Italy, he gained the nicknames Il Polpo Paul (\"Paul the Octopus\") for his long legs that look like tentacles during tackling or running and \"Pogboom\" for his explosive style and energy on the pitch. These characteristics have led him to be compared with former France international Patrick Vieira. After joining Italian side Juventus in 2012, he helped the club to four consecutive Serie A titles, as well as two Coppa Italia and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. During his time with the club, he established himself as one of the most promising young players in the world, and received the Golden Boy award in 2013, followed by the Bravo Award in 2014 and was named by The Guardian as one of the ten most promising young players in Europe. In 2016, Pogba was named to the 2015 UEFA Team of the Year as well as the 2015 FIFA FIFPro World XI, after helping Juventus to the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final. Despite leaving Manchester United on a free transfer, Pogba returned to the club in 2016 for a record transfer fee of \u20ac105 million (\u00a389.3 million); becoming the most expensive footballer of all time.\r\n\r\nInternationally, at under-20 level, he captained his nation to victory at the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup and took home the Best Player award for his performances during the tournament. He made his debut for the senior French national team on 22 March 2013 in a 3\u20131 win against Georgia, and scored his first World Cup goal on 30 June 2014 against Nigeria; he was awarded the Best Young Player Award for his performances at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, after reaching the quarter-final. He later represented his nation at UEFA Euro 2016 on home soil, where he scored one goal as his team reached the final.",

In September 2014, he was on trial at Manchester United before he had made his debut for the Newport County senior team.\r\n\r\nPoole made his Newport County debut at the age of 16 years and 94 days when he was named in the starting line-up for a League Two match against Shrewsbury Town on 20 September 2014 which ended in a 0\u20130 draw. Poole became the youngest Newport County player, surpassing the record set by Steve Aizlewood in 1969. He retained his place for the Football League Trophy first-round match against Swindon Town on 23 September 2014. Swindon won the game 2\u20131.

In 2015 he signed with Aston Villa, and a year later Middlesbrough.\r\n\r\nAdama represented Spain at under-16, under-17 and under-19 levels.\r\n\r\nBorn in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Catalonia to Malian parents, Adama joined FC Barcelona's youth setup in 2004 at the age of eight, after a brief period with neighbouring CE L'Hospitalet. In 2013 he was promoted to the B-team, and made his professional debut on 6 October in a 1\u20130 away defeat against SD Ponferradina for the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n championship.\r\n\r\nOn 9 November 2013, Adama came on as a half-time substitute but was sent off for conceding a penalty in a 3\u20130 loss to Real Ja\u00e9n CF at the Mini Estadi. Two weeks later, Adama played his first La Liga game at the age of only 17, replacing Neymar late on in the 4\u20130 home win over Granada. Three days later he made his first appearance in the UEFA Champions League, coming on for Cesc F\u00e0bregas in the 82nd minute of a 2\u20131 loss at Ajax for the group stage. Adama also featured for Barcelona's Under-19 side in the inaugural UEFA Youth League, playing five times and scoring twice as they won the trophy.\r\n\r\nAdama scored his first goal for the Blaugrana's main squad on 16 December 2014, playing 16 minutes and contributing to an 8\u20131 home demolition of SD Huesca in the Copa del Rey.\r\n\r\nOn 14 August 2015, Adama joined Premier League club Aston Villa on a five-year deal for a reported \u00a37 million (\u20ac10 million) that could rise to \u20ac12 million, with Barcelona inserting a three-year buy-back clause in his contract. He made his debut eight days later against Crystal Palace, and his cross led to an own goal from Pape Souar\u00e9 eight minutes after he had entered the game as a substitute for Carlos S\u00e1nchez. He scored his first goal three days later, the team's first of a 5\u20133 home win over Notts County in the League Cup second round.\r\n\r\nAdama came on as a second-half substitute for the last-placed Villans away to relegation rivals Sunderland on 2 January 2016, and via a counter-attack he assisted compatriot Carles Gil's aerial volley equalizer. He was later replaced himself through injury, as his team lost 3\u20131. Following that game, he was dropped from the team due to indiscipline, as the season ended with relegation.\r\n\r\nOn 31 August 2016, Adama signed with Premier League team Middlesbrough on a four-year deal, under compatriot manager Aitor Karanka. He made his debut on 10 September 2016, in a 2\u20131 home loss to Crystal Palace, replacing Cristhian Stuani for the final nine minutes.",

He has had loan spells with Plymouth Argyle, York City and Tranmere Rovers.\r\n\r\nGibson was born in Nunthorpe, North Yorkshire and attended Nunthorpe School and Yarm School. He joined Middlesbrough's youth system from Marton at the age of 12. He was a member of the Middlesbrough side that won the Nike Cup in 2008 and signed his first professional contract with the club on 1 July 2010. He made his first-team debut as a substitute on 25 April 2011 against Coventry City, coming on in the 41st minute for the injured Andrew Davies, with Middlesbrough going on to win the game 2\u20131. He finished the 2010\u201311 season with one appearance for Middlesbrough, and having captained the reserve team to The Football Combination East Division title.\r\n\r\nGibson signed a three-month loan deal with League Two club Plymouth Argyle on 2 August 2011. After making 13 appearances in this time, Gibson and both clubs involved agreed on 1 November 2011 to extend the loan deal until 29 January 2012. However, the loan was cut short after Middlesbrough recalled him on 30 November 2011. He signed for Conference Premier club York City on loan until the end of 2011\u201312 on 9 February 2012. After a promising start Gibson was sent off in the 1\u20130 away victory to Cambridge United. However, after missing the next four games through suspension he won the 2012 FA Trophy Final with York at Wembley Stadium on 12 May, in which the side beat Newport County 2\u20130. Eight days later he played in the 2\u20131 victory over Luton Town in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley on 20 May 2012, seeing the club return to the Football League after an eight-year absence with promotion to League Two. Gibson completed his loan at York with 11 appearances.\r\n\r\nOn 14 August 2012, Gibson joined League One side Tranmere Rovers on a one-month loan. The month was extended until January 2013 the following month, but in December 2012 was ruled out of action with an abductor problem. He signed a new four-year contract with Middlesbrough on 18 December 2012.\r\n\r\nGibson has competed for the England under-17s, the under-18s, the under-20s and the under-21s. He was part of the under-17 teams that won the 2009 Nordic Cup, where he scored in the final against Scotland, and the 2010 UEFA European Under-17 Championship.\r\n\r\nGibson made his debut for England under-21s in the first leg of the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification play-offs against Croatia on the back of an impressive campaign for Middlesbrough. His performances made him a key member of the under-21 set up and he formed an effective partnership with John Stones. Gibson scored his first goal for the under-21s in England's final friendly before the European Championships against Belarus. He went on to play 90 minutes in all of England's three group stage matches in the tournament although could not stop their disappointing early departure.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Grant Leadbitter (born 7 January 1986) is an English professional footballer who plays for Middlesbrough as a midfielder. He went to Park View School in Chester-le-Street. He played for Sunderland from 2003 until 2009 after rising as a product from the team's Youth Academy before signing for Ipswich Town. In 2007 Leadbitter received a call-up for England U21, and featured for them three times.\r\n\r\nLeadbitter was born in Chester-le-Street, County Durham. He grew up in Fence Houses as a Sunderland fan, and joined the Sunderland youth academy at the age of 16. He progressed through the ranks and represented England at the U19 level in 2002, scoring against Brazil to help England finish in the top four in the league tournament\r\n\r\nLeadbitter's first professional appearance for Sunderland came as a substitute in a League Cup defeat against Huddersfield Town in September 2003. Before obtaining a regular first-team place at the club, he was loaned to Rotherham United in September 2005, where he scored once against Swansea in five league games. After his loan stay in Hibernian, he began to be selected regularly by then manager Mick McCarthy, and started in several Premier League games for the Black Cats in February 2006.\r\n\r\nAfter Sunderland's relegation in 2006, Leadbitter stalled on contract talks, with many predicting he was aiming to attract the attention of a Premier League club after his impressive displays during the previous season. However, a contract was subsequently agreed with the player claiming he only ever wanted to stay with Sunderland and, henceforth, Leadbitter played an important role in the Black Cats' revival under the management of Roy Keane. Leadbitter took part in every one of Sunderland's games in the 2006\u201307 season and contributed seven goals, ranking as the club's third top scorer of that season. On Sunderland's return to the Premier League, Leadbitter continued to feature regularly with Keane, even making comparisons with Paul Scholes (he allegedly wears the number 18 shirt in honour of his hero Scholes). In June 2008 Leadbitter signed a new contract with Sunderland, keeping him at the club until 2011.\r\n\r\nOn 4 October 2008, Leadbitter scored a memorable goal against Arsenal after just coming off the bench. The 25-yard goal was celebrated in emotional style, as he ran over to his manager and had his head on the floor, nearly in tears. This emotional celebration was because his father, Brian Leadbitter, had died just weeks beforehand and his ashes had been buried right on that spot under the grass on Stadium of Light. \"People close to me know why I went down on the floor like I did, I just want to leave it at that. The people who know me know why I kissed that area of the ground. My dad's ashes were buried there. I don't want to go on about it. It just means a lot to me and my family. It's exactly that spot and it was always my intention to do something like that when I scored my first goal here.\" Leadbitter said to the press after the match.\r\n\r\nAfter Leadbitter's contract expired in 2012 after three seasons with Ipswich, he signed another three-year contract, this time with Middlesbrough. Leadbitter scored on his debut in a 7\u20133 pre-season friendly win against Falkirk. He scored his first league goal on 30 November 2012 in a 2\u20133 away defeat against Birmingham City. Leadbitter scored twice as Boro lost 3\u20132 away to Wolverhampton Wanderers in March 2013. After a string of consistent performances throughout the 2012\u201313 season, Leadbitter was awarded Middlesbrough's player of the season in his first season at the club. Leadbitter scored his fourth goal for Middlesbrough on 25 August 2013 at Wigan. On 21 September 2013, he scored Boro's final goal in a 3\u20133 draw at home to Bournemouth. On 19 December 2014 Leadbitter agreed a 3-year contract extension with the club. Leadbitter's commanding performances and selection of spectacular goals lead to him being named in the Professional Footballers' Association's Championship Team of the Year.\r\n\r\nOn 7 May 2016, Leadbitter won promotion to the Premier League with Middlesbrough after a 1-1 draw at home against Brighton & Hove Albion.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Stewart Downing (born 22 July 1984) is an English professional footballer who plays for Middlesbrough and the England national team. He has played most of his career as a winger, where he operates predominantly on the left-hand side, though he can play on the right and go inside on to his stronger left foot. Downing has also played in the left-back position and more recently as an attacking central midfielder.\r\n\r\nHe was formed at Middlesbrough, where after a loan at Sunderland, he became a key part of the team, winning the League Cup in 2004 and helping them to the UEFA Cup final two years later. In 2009, after Boro's relegation, he joined Aston Villa for an initial \u00a310 million, then moved on to Liverpool for twice that amount two years later, again winning the League Cup in 2012. He played for two seasons at West Ham United before returning to Middlesbrough.\r\n\r\nA full international since 2005, Downing has earned 35 caps for England. He was included in the nation's squads that reached the quarter-finals at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012.\r\n\r\nDowning was born in Middlesbrough, and was a graduate of the Middlesbrough Academy. His debut came on 24 April 2002 in a Premier League game away at Ipswich Town, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1\u20130 loss at Portman Road. He was limited to just three appearances during that season, plus a further three the following season. His first senior goal came on 1 October 2002 in a 4\u20131 League Cup second round away victory over Brentford, coming on as a substitute to conclude the scoring at Griffin Park.\r\n\r\nOn 30 October 2003, Downing went on a one-month loan to Sunderland, of the Championship. He scored three goals in seven games for Mick McCarthy's Black Cats team, starting on 4 November when he equalised in a 3\u20131 win at Gillingham, also assisting John Oster. Having scored as many goals on his loan as Middlesbrough's top scorer Szil\u00e1rd N\u00e9meth had recorded all season, Downing was recalled from his loan on 11 December due to injury to Juninho. He was a regular for the remainder of the season, but was an unused substitute on 29 February 2004, when they won the League Cup final against Bolton Wanderers.\r\n\r\nThe 2004\u201305 season saw Downing make 49 appearances, scoring six goals, as well as providing numerous assists. In a UEFA Cup match against Lazio in November 2004, both Downing and Zenden were in the starting line-up. Though Zenden scored both goals in the 2\u20130 victory, Downing drew praise for his performance down the left. Such performances that season saw him called up to Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's England squad in February 2005 for a friendly against the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nA knee injury saw Downing sidelined for five months at the end of 2005, though he returned to play his part in the run to the 2006 UEFA Cup Final, including three assists in the 4\u20132 (4\u20133 agg) victory over Steaua Bucharest in the semi-final second leg.\r\n\r\nOn 26 February 2008, Downing signed a new five-year contract, keeping him signed on at Middlesbrough until summer 2013. With the departure of Mark Schwarzer in May 2008, Downing became Middlesbrough's second longest serving player after Brad Jones.\r\n\r\nThe 2008\u201309 season was a mixed one for Downing. Middlesbrough had their best start to the season in six years which saw them climb to 8th in the table, however, a terrible winless run which started in November 2008 saw them fall into the relegation zone. On 5 January 2009, he handed in a written transfer request expressing his desire to leave the club but the request was turned down on the same day. In the penultimate match of the season, he sustained a foot injury after a challenge from Stiliyan Petrov in a home game against Aston Villa in May, which needed an operation, ruling him out for at least four months. After spending the whole of the second half of the season in the relegation zone, Middlesbrough were relegated on the final day after they lost 2\u20131 away at West Ham United. Downing, having started every league game, except the last match, ended the season with no league goals, having only scored two against West Ham United in the FA Cup.",

He then decided in 2004 to move to AGF and then later FC Midtjylland in his native Denmark, Fischer joined the youth of AFC Ajax, where he played for the A1 selection in his first year with the Amsterdam side, having signed a 3-year contract, binding him to the club until 30 June 2014. He had attracted interest from other clubs as well, such as Chelsea, Inter Milan, Manchester City and Manchester United due to his performance for Denmark in the U17 World Cup, but decided to sign with Ajax instead. In his first season with Ajax, Fischer played for the Ajax A1 youth squad, helping his team to the finals of the NextGen Series, the Champions League equivalent for under-20 youth squads. Ajax would eventually lose the final to Inter Milan 5\u20133 on penalties, when the match ended 1\u20131 after extra time, finishing the tournament as runners-up. Fischer also finished as joint top scorer of the competition with 7 goals, together with Cameroonian youth International Jean Marie Dongou from FC Barcelona.\r\n\r\nFischer made his debut for the Ajax first team in the 2012\u201313 pre-season, in a win against SV Huizen, defeating the Huizen side 3\u20131, scoring his first goal in the 63rd minute. He made his Eredivisie debut on 20 October 2012 as a substitute in the 84th minute of a match against Heracles Almelo which ended in a 3\u20133 draw. He scored his first goal in a regular season for Ajax on 31 October 2012 starting the match against ONS Sneek in the KNVB Cup making it 1\u20130 in the 74th minute in the 2\u20130 win. His Champions League debut was in the group D fixture of the 2012-13 UEFA Champions League series on 6 November 2012, in an away match against Manchester City, which ended in a 2\u20132 draw, coming in as an '87 minute substitute for Christian Poulsen, making his continental debut at the top flight, at the age of 18 years. Having started in the Dutch Super Cup match against PSV on 5 August 2012, and a Dutch Cup match against ONS Sneek on 31 October 2012, Fischer played in the starting lineup of Ajax in an Eredivisie match for the first time on 11 November 2012, against PEC Zwolle, scoring twice and helping his side to a 4\u20132 away win.\r\n\r\nOn 20 January 2013, Fischer played in his first Klassieker match against arch-rivals Feyenoord from Rotterdam, starting on the Left wing, he earned himself the Man of the Match award after scoring the first two goals in the first half of the match. His first goal in the 7' minute saw Fischer attacking from the left, and dribbling past the last defender and the keeper to score on the empty goal, while his second goal in the 40' minute came from the right side of the box, after he stripped the ball from Feyenoord defender Joris Mathijsen and volleyed it into the back of the net, Ajax went into halftime up by two goals. He was substituted in the 61' minute for Ryan Babel, with the match ending 3\u20130 for the Amsterdam side, in what would be the club's 50th all time victory over Feyenoord at home in Eredivisie history.\r\n\r\nOn 18 February 2013 it was announced by Frank de Boer in De Telegraaf, that Viktor Fischer had extended his contract with Ajax until 2017.\r\n\r\nIn a debut year that saw Fischer emerge as Frank de Boer's first choice on the Left wing, 5 May 2013 saw Fischer help his side secure the 5\u20130 victory at home needed against Willem II, scoring in the 68'-minute of the match to secure the top position in the Eredivisie table, and thus the clubs 3rd consecutive national title and 32nd overall. Later that same day, Fischer was announced as AFC Ajax Talent of the Year, for his outstanding debut season, which saw him find the back of the net ten times, scoring twelve goals in all competitions all together.\r\n\r\nOn 26 May 2016, Fischer's transfer to Middlesbrough was made official. Ajax received a transfer fee of \u20ac5 million with Fischer signing a four-year contract binding him to the club until 2020.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Alex Simon McCarthy (born 3 December 1989) is an English footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Southampton. A product of Reading's Academy, McCarthy spent time out on loan in the Conference before signing professional terms with the club in 2008. He made his Football League debut in 2009 whilst on loan to Aldershot Town and spent the following season at Yeovil Town before making his Reading debut in 2011. He has since spent time on loan at Leeds United and Ipswich Town. McCarthy left for Queens Park Rangers in 2014.\r\n\r\nAt international level McCarthy has represented England and made his debut for the under-21 side in 2010, appearing three times in total. In May 2013 he was called up to the senior squad for friendlies against the Republic of Ireland and Brazil although he did not make an appearance.\r\n\r\nBorn in Guildford, Surrey, McCarthy began his career as a schoolboy at Wimbledon and Wycombe Wanderers before joining Reading on a scholarship at 16. He was a regular in the Academy team for two years and was part of a group that included several future first-team players including Jem Karacan, Alex Pearce and Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson. His first experience of senior football came in August 2007 at Woking where he made one appearance cover for the injured Nick Gindre. On 26 March 2008 he joined fellow Conference National team Cambridge United on work experience, making his debut two days later in a 3\u20130 defeat to Kidderminster Harriers. He made no further appearances and returned to Reading before signing his first professional contract in July 2008. McCarthy moved on loan again on 24 October 2008, joining Conference South team Team Bath as injury cover. He made his debut the next day in the FA Cup Fourth Qualifying Round against Salisbury City and also played in the First Round defeat to Forest Green, making four appearances in total. Another short loan spell followed with McCarthy joining League Two side Aldershot Town for one month on 2 February 2009. He made his Football League debut twelve days later in a 3\u20132 defeat to Exeter City and played three further matches before returning to Reading at the beginning of March.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the 2009\u201310 season McCarthy joined League One side Yeovil on an initial six-month loan and made his debut on 8 August in a 2\u20130 home win over Tranmere Rovers. A month later he received the first sending-off of his career after fouling Stockport County's Nicholas Bignall who was also on loan from Reading. McCarthy's loan spell was renewed in January 2010 and again in February, before being extended for the rest of the season on 24 March. Over the course of his spell he played 44 league games and kept all twelve of Yeovil's clean sheets. Following his successful loan, McCarthy was given a new three-year contract at Reading, keeping him with the club until 2013. He again departed on loan in August 2010, joining Brentford, though he remained there for just one month before being replaced by fellow Reading loanee Ben Hamer.\r\n\r\nMcCarthy trained with the England under-19s before joining the under-21 set-up for the first time in September 2009. He received several further call-ups to the under-21s in 2009\u201310 and eventually made his debut as a second-half substitute against Uzbekistan in August 2010. In March 2011 he was named in a 31-man squad to face Denmark and Iceland as preparation for the European Under-21 Championship. He played a full 90 minutes in the first game and 45 in the second as England won 4\u20130 and lost 2\u20131 respectively. He travelled with the squad to championships in Denmark but did not play any games, finishing with three caps at under-21 level.\r\n\r\nIn April 2012, McCarthy was named in the 80-man longlist of potential players for the Great Britain football team at the 2012 Olympics, and in June, he made it down to the shortlist of 35 players provisionally selected for the tournament, although he did not make the final 18.\r\n\r\nIn May 2013 he was called up to the England senior team for the friendlies against Republic of Ireland and Brazil, becoming the first Reading youth team graduate to gain a full England call-up since the Academy era began in 1998, although he did not make an appearance.",

Released from his contract by Reading as a youth, Austin played non-league football up to May 2009, when he was signed by Swindon Town after a prolific season for Poole Town. After scoring 58 goals in 113 matches in the Football League Championship for Burnley and Queens Park Rangers, Austin made his debut in the Premier League during the 2014\u201315 season, scoring 18 goals for relegated QPR and receiving a call-up for the England national team. He returned to the Premier League in January 2016 when he signed for Southampton, scoring on his debut.\r\n\r\nBorn in Hungerford, Berkshire, Austin trained with Reading's youth teams as a youngster but was released for being too small when he was 15. He subsequently played for local team Kintbury Rangers and his hometown side Hungerford Town. Austin departed Hungerford in 2008 and was briefly on the books of Thatcham Town but ultimately left without making any appearances for the club.\r\n\r\nMoving with his family to Bournemouth, he then switched to nearby semi-professional Wessex League Premier Division team Poole Town while also working as a bricklayer. In the season of 2008\u201309, Austin scored 46 goals in 46 appearances for Poole in all competitions.\r\n\r\nAustin spent the pre-season of the 2009\u201310 season on trial with League Two club Bournemouth. Although Bournemouth's manager, Eddie Howe, was keen to sign the striker on a permanent deal, Bournemouth were unable to make a move for the striker due to a transfer embargo imposed on the club by the Football League. Austin continued to play for Poole Town, scoring 18 goals in 11 games at the beginning of the season.\r\n\r\nOn 16 January 2016, Austin returned to the Premier League, joining Southampton on a four-and-a-half-year deal for a reported fee of \u00a34 million. He made his debut for the club a week later against Manchester United, coming on as a second-half substitute for Sadio Man\u00e9, and scored a late winner, turning in a free-kick from James Ward-Prowse.\r\n\r\nAustin and his long-term partner Bianca Parker have a daughter, born in August 2012.\r\n\r\nAustin was found guilty of assault in 2013 after he punched a man who had accused him of taking drugs in a Swindon nightclub toilet cubicle. He was fined \u00a31,800 and ordered to pay \u00a31,320 in costs.\r\n\r\nOn 21 May 2015, Austin was called up for the first time to the England national football team for a friendly match against the Republic of Ireland and a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against Slovenia. He and Leicester City forward Jamie Vardy were called up due to several other forwards being involved in the European Under-21 Championship, but Austin did not feature in either match.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Jack Stephens (born 27 January 1994) is an English footballer who plays as a defender for Southampton. Born in Torpoint, he began his career as a youth player with Plymouth Argyle, remaining with the club as a professional until 2011. Although starting his career as a right back, Stephens has recently been converted into a centre back. He can also operate as a left back, or in a defensive midfielder role, and has played internationally for the England under-18, under-19 and under-20 sides.\r\n\r\nBorn in Torpoint, Stephens attended Torpoint Community College, and joined Plymouth Argyle in 2005 at the age of 11. He progressed to the club's youth team in 2009 after a number of impressive performances in the junior section of the Milk Cup. He was then promoted to the club's reserve team, having appeared regularly in the Youth Alliance. Stephens began training with the club's first team in September 2010 and was included in an 18-man squad for their league match against Sheffield Wednesday. He made his debut as a late substitute in a 3\u20132 win for Argyle. Primarily a right back, Stephens can play in a variety of positions. \"Jack is a right-back but he can play in the centre as well. He's comfortable in both positions,\" said John James, the club's youth development officer. \"I like him at right-back because he does get forward well, he's quick, he likes to take people on and he's a good header of the ball. He's a big lad \u2013 6ft 1in I think \u2013 and he's still growing.\"\r\n\r\nHe joined Southampton on 5 April 2011 for a fee of \u00a3150,000, signing an initial three-year contract, and was placed in the club's development squad. Stephens made his first-team debut for Southampton in a 2\u20131 FA Cup win against Coventry City on 7 January 2012, coming on as a second-half substitute for Dan Harding. In 2012 he was promoted to the first team ahead of the club's return to the Premier league.\r\n\r\nStephens received his first call-up for the England under-18 side for a match against Poland in March 2012, playing the first half of the 3\u20130 win at Crewe Alexandra home ground Alexandra Stadium. Later in the year he made the step up to the under-19 team, making his debut on 26 September in a 3\u20130 win over Estonia in the qualifying stages of the 2013 European Championships, playing the full 90 minutes. He later played 45 minutes of the 6\u20130 win over the Faroe Islands on 28 September (after which he was replaced by fellow Southampton player Calum Chambers, who scored the sixth goal), the full 90 minutes of the 1\u20131 draw with Ukraine on 1 October, and the first half of the 13 November 1\u20130 friendly win over Finland which also featured Southampton midfielder James Ward-Prowse. Stephens made his debut for the England under-21 side on 12 November 2015 in a 0-0 draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, but was sent off in the 72nd minute.\r\n\r\nHe was part of the team that won the 2016 Toulon Tournament, their first such win for 22 years.",

He made a first Ligue 1 start in the game against Valenciennes in week 5 and scored a headed goal in the 26th minute from Jimmy Briand's cross. The match ended 1\u20131 with Pied being named the man of the match by L'Equipe. On 14 September 2010, he played his first Champions League match against Schalke 04, entering shortly after the hour mark, replacing Michel Bastos, the goalscorer in the 1\u20130 victory. Pied's promising performances earned him the trust of Claude Puel and he started playing regularly starting matches or coming in from the bench. On 2 October 2010 he played the full match against Nancy and made an assist to the second goal of the match scored by Briand. Lyon eventually won the game 3\u20132. On 17 October 2010, Pied again made the starting lineup in a vital match against Lille. After all four goals of the game were scored, he quickly picked up two yellow cards which saw him expelled from the game, but Lyon held on and won the game 3\u20131. On 14 November 2010, he volleyed the only goal of the match, and his second goal of the season, against Nice after Yoann Gourcuff's cross. On 3 December 2010, Olympique Lyonnais announced contract extension for Pied for two years until June 2014. Pied scored his third goal for Lyon in 4\u20130 victory over Nancy coming off the bench in the 69th minute and scoring a header from a Michel Bastos cross.\r\n\r\nHe scored his first 2011\u201312 Ligue 1 season goal on 27 August 2011 against Montpellier.\r\n\r\nOn 26 August 2012, Pied completed a move to Ligue 1 rivals OGC Nice, signing a four-year contract for \u20ac3 million transfer fee. He was loaned for the 2014\u201315 season to En Avant de Guingamp.\r\n\r\nOn 1 August 2016, Pied rejoined manager Claude Puel for the third time in his career when he signed a two-year deal with Southampton, joining on a free transfer.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Jordy Clasie (Dutch pronunciation: ; born 27 June 1991) is a Dutch footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Southampton and for the Dutch national team.\r\n\r\nClasie arrived at the youth Feyenoord Academy (Varkenoord) as a 9-year-old in the summer of 2000 and progressed through the ranks to the Feyenoord/Excelsior U19s. In the summer of 2010 the Harlem-born youngster went out on loan to Excelsior. Clasie made his professional debut for Excelsior on 15 August 2010, when he was part of the starting line-up in the Rotterdam derby victory against Feyenoord (3\u20132).\r\n\r\nClasie was brought into the first-team squad at Feyenoord at the start of the 2011/2012 season and incoming coach Ronald Koeman immediately handed the youngster a place in the starting line-up. On 31 July 2011 he made his debut for Feyenoord in a friendly game against M\u00e1laga. Because of his good play and his tenacity he soon became one of the most popular players among the supporters.\r\n\r\nOn 29 August 2014, a day after Clasie helped Feyenoord qualify for the group stage of the UEFA Europa League, Clasie agreed to extend his contract until 2018. Clasie explained the decision that he was keen on developing himself as a player within the team as well as developing together with the team as a whole.\r\n\r\nHowever, on 15 July 2015, Clasie signed for Southampton on a five-year deal for a fee in the region of \u00a38 million. This meant he would once again link up with Ronald Koeman who brought him into the Feyenoord first-team.\r\n\r\nIn November 2010, two months after his debut for Excelsior, he was selected for the Netherlands U21 squad. In February 2012, Bert van Marwijk, the coach of the first team of the Netherlands, pronounced his interest in Clasie. He was made aware that his name was on the stand-by list for Euro 2012.\r\n\r\nClasie was part of Louis van Gaal's 23-man squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil where the Dutch finished third beating the likes of defending champions Spain and hosts Brazil. He made two appearances in the tournament, coming on as a substitute for Nigel de Jong in the semi-finals against Argentina and started the third place game against the hosts which the Dutch won 3-0 comfortably.",

In the 2008 season, he was in the starting lineup for most of the league matches with his Serbian teammate Milo\u0161 Bajalica. He scored Nagoya Grampus's historical first goal in the AFC Champions League in the game against Ulsan Hyundai Horang-i on 10 March 2009.\r\n\r\nOn 30 August 2012, he agreed to join Southampton on a three-year contract for a fee thought to be in the region of \u00a33 million. He made his debut for the Saints on 15 September 2012, against Arsenal in a 6\u20131 defeat, coming on as a 28th-minute substitute for Jos Hooiveld. He then made his home debut a week later on 22 September 2012 in a 4\u20131 win over Aston Villa, playing the whole 90 minutes.\r\n\r\nOn 9 August 2013, it was announced that Yoshida would be on the front cover of the Japanese Edition of FIFA 14.\r\n\r\nHe scored his first goal for Southampton in a 2\u20131 defeat to Sunderland in the League Cup on 6 November 2013.

    "strDescriptionEN": "Nathan Daniel Jerome Redmond (born 6 March 1994) is an English professional footballer who plays for Southampton.\r\n\r\nRedmond began his career as a youngster with Birmingham City, his home-town club. He made his first-team debut in the Football League Cup second-round tie against Rochdale in August 2010, becoming the club's second-youngest player ever at the age of 16 years and 173 days. After representing England at levels up to under-19, Redmond made his first under-21 appearance in the 2013 European Under-21 Championship finals. He joined Premier League club Norwich City in the 2013 close season, before making the switch to Southampton from Norwich in the 2016 close season.\r\n\r\nHe typically plays as a wide midfielder. He is right-footed, but has regularly played on both right and left wings, often cutting inside. He has also occasionally played in the centre behind a lone striker.\r\n\r\nRedmond was born in Birmingham, West Midlands, where he grew up in the Kitts Green district, attending the Oval Primary School in Yardley and then Sheldon Heath Community Arts College. According to the player's Facebook page, he was first noticed by Birmingham City F.C.'s Academy scouts as an eight-year-old while playing alongside older boys, and scored a hat-trick in his first match for the club's under-10 team.\r\n\r\nHe scored three goals as Birmingham's under-15 team reached the semifinal of the Nike Premier Cup for the first time in April 2009, and in the same season played in the club's under-18 Academy side.\r\n\r\nIn the 2009\u201310 season, while still a schoolboy, Redmond made 15 appearances, scoring 3 times, for the Academy under-18s. He also made a few substitute appearances for the reserve team, including a \"lively late performance\" against Aston Villa reserves in early March 2010. Redmond was given a first-team squad number and named on standby for the Premier League match at home to Everton a couple of days later, but did not make the 18-man squad. He was an unused substitute for Birmingham's final home match of the 2009\u201310 season, aged 16 years and 56 days. Had he taken the field, he would have become the club's youngest first-team player and also the youngest ever Premier League player, at nine days younger than the record set by Fulham's Matthew Briggs in 2007.\r\n\r\nAcademy manager Terry Westley described him in June 2010 as \"one of those wingers like an Aaron Lennon or Ashley Young. He has got pace and can run the ball past defenders and has the creativity to go with it\", and confirmed that other clubs had shown an interest in him. He signed a scholarship contract with Birmingham City in July 2010.\r\n\r\nThe sale of Butland to Stoke City in January meant that no other players needed to leave in that transfer window, and Clark made it clear towards the end of the season that it would be a foolish move to cash in on Redmond in the close season. However, at the start of the 2013 summer transfer window, Birmingham accepted bids from Premier League clubs Swansea City and Norwich City, reportedly an initial \u00a32 million plus up to \u00a31.2m in additional payments. Redmond chose to rejoin Chris Hughton at Norwich, where he signed a four-year contract.\r\n\r\nHe made his debut for Norwich in a 2\u20132 draw with Everton on 17 August 2013, and scored his first goal two weeks later against Southampton; playing on the left wing \u2013 not his natural side \u2013 he \"cut inside and lashed home low from the edge of the box\" to secure Norwich's first league win of the season.\r\n\r\nOn 25 June 2016, Redmond completed a move to Premier League club Southampton for an undisclosed fee, believed by BBC Sport to be \u00a310m. He signed a five-year contract.\r\n\r\nHe scored on his competitive debut, with the equalising goal in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Watford on 13 August 2016.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Pierre-Emile Kordt H\u00f8jbjerg (Danish pronunciation: , sometimes spelled H\u00f6jbjerg in Germany; born 5 August 1995) is a Danish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Southampton.\r\n\r\nWith his former club Bayern Munich, he won a variety of domestic and international tournaments. Formerly a youth international at various levels from under-16 to under-21, he made his debut for the Denmark national football team in 2014.\r\n\r\nWhile initially playing in BK Skjold and F.C. Copenhagen he moved to Br\u00f8ndby IF as a junior player at age 14. He looks upon Zinedine Zidane as his role model. Starting from his debut, H\u00f8jbjerg plays as a central midfielder and sometimes right wide midfielder.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, H\u00f8jbjerg was honoured with the title \"Danish under-17 player of the year\". In 2013, he was honoured with the title \"Danish talent of the year\" by Spillerforeningen (the Danish equivalent of the English PFA).\r\n\r\nH\u00f8jbjerg joined Bayern in July 2012 and, at the age of 17 years and 251 days, made his professional debut on 13 April 2013 in the Bundesliga against 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg, as a substitute for Xherdan Shaqiri and thus became the youngest player ever to play for the Bayern Munich first team in the Bundesliga. He finished the 2012\u201313 season with no goals in two matches played for the first team and eight goals in 30 matches played for the reserve team.\r\n\r\nIn December of that year, he was in the Bayern squad which won the 2013 FIFA Club World Cup in Morocco, although he did not enter the field of play during the tournament.\r\n\r\nOn 17 May 2014, H\u00f8jbjerg started the DFB-Pokal final for Bayern Munich, a 2\u20130 extra-time win over Borussia Dortmund. He played for a total of 102 minutes before being substituted in the first half of extra time for Daniel Van Buyten. He finished the 2013\u201314 season with seven Bundesliga appearances and two German Cup appearances for the first team and four goals from 14 appearances for the reserve team.\r\n\r\nHis first match of the 2014\u201315 season was the DFL-Supercup on 13 August, playing the first hour and then being substituted for Mario G\u00f6tze, as Bayern lost 2\u20130 at Borussia Dortmund. On 8 January 2015, Bayern extended H\u00f8jbjerg's contract to 2018. He finished the 2014\u201315 season with no goals from eight Bundesliga appearances, one German Cup appearance, and three Champions League appearances.\r\n\r\nOn 7 January 2015, H\u00f8jbjerg was loaned to FC Augsburg, also of the Bundesliga, for the remainder of the 2014\u201315 season. He made his debut on 1 February 2015 against 1899 Hoffenheim. H\u00f8jbjerg scored his first Bundesliga goal on 11 April against SC Paderborn 07 in a 2\u20131 loss. On 9 May, he assisted Ra\u00fal Bobadilla for the only goal as Augsburg won away at Bayern, who had already won the league by that point. He finished his loan spell with two goals from 16 Bundesliga appearances.\r\n\r\nOn 28 August 2015, H\u00f8jbjerg joined fellow Bundesliga side Schalke 04 on a season-long loan.\r\n\r\nOn 11 July 2016, H\u00f8jbjerg joined English club Southampton on a five-year deal for an estimated fee of \u00a312.8 million.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Shane Patrick Long (born 22 January 1987) is an Irish professional footballer who plays for Southampton and the Republic of Ireland national team as a striker. He is known as \"a powerful, no-nonsense striker.\" He also played hurling for Tipperary in his early life.\r\n\r\nLong began his football career at Cork City. He later moved to Reading where, among other achievements, he scored three goals in ten substitute appearances during his team's Championship-winning 2005\u201306 campaign, guided his team into the Fourth round of the FA Cup by defeating Liverpool in a third round replay match in 2010, and later won a player of the season award. He signed for Premier League side West Bromwich Albion in 2011 for a fee of \u00a36 million, and joined Hull City in January 2014, then Southampton in August 2014.\r\n\r\nLong made his senior debut for the Republic of Ireland in 2007, and has since earned 67 international caps.\r\n\r\nLong was born in Gortnahoe, County Tipperary, Ireland. He was a talented hurler and appeared in two All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship (Under-18) semi-finals with Tipperary at Croke Park, and was regarded as a pacey and promising forward. Long was also playing Gaelic football at this time, and started his career in the game with Two-Mile Borris club St Kevin's FC in 1994, joining St. Michael's in Tipperary Town in 2002.\r\n\r\nLong was discovered and brought to Cork City with a scholarship on 1 July 2004 by Pat Dolan. He was called to the first team squad for the 2005 season when manager Dolan was replaced by Damien Richardson, and the new manager awarded him his senior League of Ireland debut on 25 March 2005 as a substitute for Joe Gamble. His only other appearance was again as a substitute in the Setanta Sports Cup on 2 May. However, following Dolan's consultation with his brother, Reading coach Eamonn Dolan, Reading made bids for both Long and Kevin Doyle. Cork were forced to sell Doyle due to a contract clause, but the circumstances surrounding Long's transfer were not disclosed. Long signed as a Reading player on 7 June 2005.\r\n\r\nLong played in both legs of Hull's Europa League qualifying tie against AS Trenc\u00edn before the start of the 2014\u201315 Premier League season. They were his last official matches for Hull, as on 14 August 2014, Long signed a four-year contract with Southampton for an undisclosed fee, believed to be in the region of \u00a312 million.\r\n\r\nThree days later, he made his first appearance for the club, replacing fellow debutant Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107 for the final 16 minutes of a 2\u20131 defeat at Liverpool in Southampton's opening game of the league season. He almost scored a late equaliser when he nodded a header just wide of the post. Long scored his first Southampton goal against Stoke City in the League Cup Cup on 29 October, putting his team 2\u20130 up in a 3\u20132 victory.\r\n\r\nHe scored his first league goals for the club with a brace in a 2\u20130 win over Leicester City, having come on as a substitute for Sadio Man\u00e9 with 22 minutes remaining.\r\n\r\nOn 16 May 2015, Long assisted teammate Sadio Man\u00e9 twice inside three minutes as the latter scored the fastest ever hat-trick in the history of the Premier League during the first half of a 6\u20131 demolition of Aston Villa. Later on in the first half, Long himself scored twice to give the Saints a 5\u20130 lead five minutes from half-time. The second of these efforts was a 35-yard lob which was named as Southampton's Goal of the Season.\r\n\r\nIn his first appearance the following season, Long scored Southampton's final goal in a 3\u20130 victory over Dutch opponents Vitesse Arnhem at St Mary's Stadium in the first leg of the Europa League third qualifying round. He scored his first Premier League goal of the season on the opening weekend, coming off the bench against Newcastle to head the score level, bringing the game to 2\u20132. On 26 December 2015, Long scored two goals against Arsenal in a game that ended 4\u20130 to Southampton. He scored his 100th career goal in English football in the 4\u20132 home win over Manchester City on 1 May 2016.\r\n\r\nOn 21 July 2016, Long signed a new contract with Southampton, extending his stay with the club until 2020.\r\n\r\nLong's form for Reading in the 2005\u201306 season earned him four Republic of Ireland U19 caps. Due to injuries to his Reading team mate Kevin Doyle and Sunderland's Stephen Elliott, he earned his first senior cap for the Republic of Ireland in their 2\u20131 win away to San Marino on 7 February 2007.\r\n\r\nWhen Long earned his second cap as a substitute against Slovakia on 28 March 2007 he became the first person to play both hurling and international football at Croke Park, having been part of the Tipperary team for the All-Ireland Minor semi-finals in 2003 and 2004. Long scored his first international goal in a friendly 1\u20131 draw against Bolivia on 26 May 2007, and followed this with a brace in Ireland's 4\u20130 win over Denmark on 22 August 2007. He was nominated as the Football Association of Ireland Young Player of the Year for 2007.\r\n\r\nIn March 2011, Long was brought on early to replace the injured Kevin Doyle in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier against Macedonia in Dublin. His performance was rewarded with a start in Ireland's next game against Uruguay in which Long scored the first of Ireland's goals with a header in a 2\u20133 loss. On 26 May 2012, Long scored when he headed the winner in a 1\u20130 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina. He played in UEFA Euro 2012, coming off the bench against Croatia and Italy.\r\n\r\nOn 29 May 2013, Long scored his ninth goal for Ireland, a header against England at Wembley Stadium, a match which finished 1\u20131. He then captained Ireland for the first time on 2 June 2013 against Georgia, a match which Ireland won 4\u20130. On 5 March 2014, Long scored his 11th goal for his country in a 2\u20131 loss to Serbia. On 29 March 2015, Long came off the bench to score a last-minute equalizer against Poland in 2016 Euro qualifier. On 8 October 2015, Long again came off the bench to score the winning goal against reigning world champions Germany in another 2016 Euro qualifier in the Aviva Stadium.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Steven Davis (born 1 January 1985) is a Northern Irish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Southampton and is the captain of the Northern Ireland national team. Davis made his full international debut in 2005 and has since been capped over 80 times at senior level, scoring eight goals. He captained his nation at UEFA Euro 2016.\r\n\r\nDavis began his career with Premier League side Aston Villa and made his first appearance for the club in 2004 against Norwich City. He was named \"Young Player of the Year\", \"The Fans Player of the Year\" and \"Player of the Year\" for the 2005\u201306 season after making 42 appearances during the season. Davis was sold to Fulham for \u00a34 million in the summer of 2007, but moved on loan to Scottish side Rangers in January 2008 for an initial six months. He was part of the side that reached the 2008 UEFA Cup Final and that won the 2007\u201308 Scottish League Cup and 2007\u201308 Scottish Cup.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the season, he moved permanently to Rangers for \u00a33 million. He made 211 appearances for the Glasgow club, winning three consecutive league titles in 2009, 2010 and 2011, two Scottish Cups and three League Cups. Following the club's insolvency in 2012, Davis exercised his rights under TUPE regulations to rescind his contract and become a free agent, returning to the Premier League with Southampton.\r\n\r\nDavis, who was born in Ballymena, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, started his career at St Andrews Boys Club before transferring to Aston Villa in 2002. He was a member of the 2002 FA Youth Cup winning team that beat Everton 4\u20132 in the final. His first professional appearance was on 18 September 2004, he was a 57th-minute replacement for Nolberto Solano in a goalless Premier League match against Norwich City at Carrow Road. Davis made 28 league appearances across the season, scoring the winner in a 3\u20132 comeback victory at Southampton on 16 April 2005.\r\n\r\nOn 13 August 2005, in Villa's first game of the new campaign, Davis volleyed past Jussi J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen to secure a 2\u20132 home draw against Bolton Wanderers, albeit after nine minutes. He scored twice on 20 September in the third round of the Football League Cup, as Villa won 8\u20133 at Wycombe Wanderers. By October 2005, he was a regular for the club and missed only one game for Villa in the 2005\u201306 season. Davis was named Villa's \"Young Player of the Year\", \"The Fans Player of the Year\" and \"Player of the Year\" for the 2005\u201306 season. His form prompted the Northern Ireland manager Lawrie Sanchez, to state that Davis could be \"another Frank Lampard\". Davis made 102 appearances for Villa and scored nine times. On 2 January 2006, he headed the first goal of a 2\u20131 win at rivals West Bromwich Albion.\r\n\r\nDavis rejected the chance to stay with Rangers and instead signed a three-year deal with Premier League side Southampton on 6 July 2012. The deal was subsequently extended to 2016 as part of the agreement with Rangers to complete the transfer without the need for the international transfer clearance to be agreed by FIFA, with the two clubs agreeing a fee. After joining Southampton, Davis pleaded the Rangers fans to agree with his decision to leave but accepted that a minority of fans would take a different view and made his explanation he left Rangers in order to revive his football career.\r\n\r\nHe made his debut on 19 August 2012, and scored to put the team ahead at holders Manchester City only three minutes after coming on as a substitute, but Southampton eventually lost 3\u20132. His only other goal of the season came against the same opposition, in a 3\u20131 home win on 13 February 2013.\r\n\r\nHis first two goals of the 2013\u201314 season came in a 5\u20131 victory at Barnsley in the League Cup second round on 27 August, the latter being a penalty.\r\n\r\nOn 17 October 2014, Davis signed a new contract to keep him at Southampton until 2018.\r\n\r\nOn 8 May 2016, Davis scored his first ever league brace for Southampton in a 2\u20131 win over Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. He followed this up with a goal in a 4\u20131 victory over Crystal Palace on the final day of the season.\r\n\r\nOn 18 June 2016, he signed a new 3-year contract, extending his stay with the club until 2019.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Geoffrey Scott \"Geoff\" Cameron (born July 11, 1985) is an American soccer player who plays for Premier League side Stoke City and the United States national team.\r\n\r\nCameron began playing college soccer with the West Virginia Mountaineers and the Rhode Island Rams, as well as USL Premier Development League side Rhode Island Stingrays, before being drafted by Major League Soccer club Houston Dynamo in 2008. After an impressive second season in professional soccer Cameron was named as MLS Best XI in 2009 and helped Houston reach the final of the MLS Cup in 2011 as they lost 1\u20130 to the Los Angeles Galaxy. In August 2012 he joined English Premier League side Stoke City. He became a regular starter at Stoke firstly under the management of Tony Pulis and then Mark Hughes.\r\n\r\nCameron was born in Attleboro, Massachusetts and played youth soccer for Bayside United. He attended Attleboro High School and Providence Country Day School before choosing West Virginia University for college. After making 28 starts in two seasons at West Virginia Mountaineers, Cameron transferred to the University of Rhode Island for his junior and senior years. Cameron was an immediate starter and helped the Rhode Island Rams beat the Rutgers Scarlet Knights in the 2006 NCAA tournament, scoring in a shootout. As a senior in 2007, Cameron was named midfielder of the Year in the Atlantic 10 Conference and was a first-team all-Mid Atlantic Region selection. During his college years, Cameron also played for Rhode Island Stingrays in the USL Premier Development League where he played 33 times in two seasons scoring eight goals.\r\n\r\nCameron received his first call up to train with the senior United States national team in January 2009, but he was injured during the first week and was unable to play in the team's friendly against Sweden. He participated again in training with the team in Carson, California in January 2010, leading up to a friendly match against Honduras. Cameron did not play in that match, but he was again called into camp for the February 24, 2010 game against El Salvador in Tampa, Florida. He appeared as a substitute in the 86th minute for Robbie Rogers, recording his first cap for the national side, nearly scoring on a blazing strike that narrowly went over the bar. In December 2011, Cameron was called up to coach J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann's camp. On January 21, 2012, he went 90 minutes in a friendly against Venezuela. Cameron scored his goal for the national team on May, 29 in a 4\u20132 defeat against Belgium.\r\n\r\nCameron was a part of the United States national team during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He started as central defender during the team's first two group stage games against Ghana and Portugal. He was benched for the third game against Germany. In the Round of 16 defeat against Belgium, Cameron started in right midfield.\r\n\r\nA versatile player who is currently featured as center back but can also play as a right back,right winger, defensive midfielder, or attacking midfielder, Cameron has become known for his combination of aerial ability,passing ability, strength,athleticism, man marking and composure on the ball. Former United States international Alexi Lalas believes that Cameron has the ability to succeed in English football.\r\n\r\n\"Geoff has the mentality and all the skill-sets to succeed . . . Stoke and England are getting a quality player that they can be excited to see. He's good with the ball, he reads the game well and he's not going to lose possession of the ball while under pressure. If you're playing with Geoff Cameron, be prepared to play with the ball. He has the physical attributes to bang when he needs to but he also has a real confidence in the way he handles the ball and the way he passes out of the back.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his time at Houston Dynamo, Cameron took part in a series of community service efforts to raise money for local charitable organizations in 2011 and 2012. The 20 for 20 campaign was started in September 2011 when Cameron, who wore the No. 20 jersey in Houston, announced a goal to raise a total of $20,000 for the Fisher House and Ronald McDonald House of Houston. In March 2012, Cameron and the Dynamo announced the return of the 20 for 20 campaign with the same initial goal of $20,000, with proceeds going to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. Growing up Cameron supported English side Manchester United and Italian side Juventus. Since living in England Cameron has participated in local community work. Cameron spoke of his horror at the Boston Marathon bombings as some of his family live close to where the attack took place.",

He helped Guingamp to promotion from the Championnat National in 2010\u201311. He established himself as a key member of the Guingamp team in Ligue 2 and one of the stand out players in the division which saw him win the Ligue 2 Player of the Year Award. This prompted Ligue 1 side Marseille to sign Imbula for a fee of \u20ac7 million. He spent two seasons at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome before joining Portuguese side Porto in the summer of 2015 for \u20ac20 million. After seven months at Porto, Imbula joined English Premier League side Stoke City for a club record \u00a318.3 million.\r\n\r\nImbula was born in Vilvoorde, Belgium, to Congolese parents, who moved to Paris when he was young. Growing up he played youth team football with US Argenteuil, Racing Club, Paris Saint-Germain before moving to Guingamp when he was 15.\r\n\r\nImbula progressed through the youth team at the Stade du Roudourou and made his professional debut in Ligue 2 on 16 October 2009 in a game against Dijon, becoming the youngest player in Ligue 2 history at 17 years, 1 month and 4 days of age. He played 33 times in 2010\u201311, scoring twice helping Guingamp gain an instant promotion back to Ligue 2. He made 30 appearances in 2011\u201312 as the side finished seventh which was followed by promotion to Ligue 1 in 2012\u201313, with Imbula making 36 appearances, scoring two goals and he was named Ligue 2 Player of the Year.\r\n\r\nBorn to Congolese parents, Imbula was born in Belgium but raised in France, making him eligible for any of these three countries. In 2013, he received a call up from France U21 to compete in the Toulon Tournament. In October 2015, however, Imbula publicly expressed his desire to play for the Belgium national team, for which reason he has required authorization to FIFA to do so.\r\n\r\nImbula plays as a defensive midfielder and has been described by Mark Hughes as being able to play in centre midfield.\u2014\"He's a defensive midfielder and he's got a lot of attributes in terms of understanding that role, but he can play in a three as well. I like that flexibility in players because it gives me more options. He's a good young player with good power, good ability on the ball, and a good range of passing.\"",

After debuting in 2004, he represented PSV for eight seasons, before moving to Barcelona for \u20ac3 million in January 2011. Rarely used by Barcelona and marred by injury, he was loaned to Schalke 04 and Olympiacos before signing for Stoke City in 2015.\r\n\r\nMaking his Netherlands national team debut in 2007, Afellay appeared at the 2010 World Cup, contributing to the Dutch side finishing in second place in the tournament. He was also present at Euro 2008 and Euro 2012, making over 50 appearances in total.\r\n\r\nAfellay is of Moroccan Riffian descent; his parents left their hometown Al Hoceima in the 1960s to work in the Netherlands. He grew up in Overvecht, a neighbourhood in Utrecht with a large immigrant population. Afellay and his brother, Ali, were brought up by their mother, Habiba, after his father died when he was young. Afellay started to play football at local side VSK, but joined USV Elinkwijk after one season.\r\n\r\nAfellay joined Premier League side Stoke City on a two-year contract on 27 July 2015. He made his debut on 9 August, in a 1\u20130 defeat against Liverpool at the Britannia Stadium, playing 78 minutes before making way for Peter Odemwingie. He was sent-off against West Bromwich Albion on 29 August 2015, for slapping Craig Gardner. He scored his first goal for Stoke on 1 December 2015 in a 2\u20130 League Cup victory against Sheffield Wednesday. Afellay scored his first Premier League goal on 13 February 2016 in a 3\u20131 win against Bournemouth. He scored his second Premier League goal on his 30th Birthday in a 2\u20132 Draw with Swansea City on 2 April 2016 where his side let a 2 goal advantage slip. On 22 April 2016 Afellay suffered a serious knee in training, ruling him out for up to eight months. In total Afellay played 36 times for Stoke in 2015\u201316 scoring three goals as the side finished in ninth position.\r\n\r\nAfter both the Moroccan and the Dutch national teams managers selected him for their squads, he was caught in the dilemma to either play for the Moroccan national team, because of his Moroccan descent, or to play for the Dutch team, the Netherlands being his place of birth and residence. He ultimately decided to play for the Dutch national team despite the heavy competition for places in midfield. He made his international debut in a Euro 2008 qualifier against Slovenia on 28 March 2007. On 12 October 2010, Afellay scored his first international goals in a Euro 2012 qualifier against Sweden. He played in the Euro 2008 as a substitute. Just seconds after replacing Dirk Kuyt in the group match against Italy he nearly scored a goal but his volley went off the crossbar. In their last group game against Romania, he was given a place in the starting eleven alongside Arjen Robben in midfield.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Jack Butland (born 10 March 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Stoke City and the England national team.\r\n\r\nButland began his career with Birmingham City, and made his debut in the Football League in September 2011 while on loan to League Two club Cheltenham Town. Butland established himself as first choice keeper at St Andrew's in 2012\u201313 and was transferred to Premier League club Stoke City in January 2013 for a fee of \u00a33.3 million. He was loaned back to Birmingham and went on to play in every league match in 2012\u201313. Butland then spent time out on loan at Barnsley before making his Premier League debut in January 2014. He had loan spells with Leeds United and Derby County in 2014 before he became Stoke's number one in 2015\u201316.\r\n\r\nAt international level, he represented England at all age-group levels, playing for the under-17 team that won the 2010 European championships and for the under-20s at the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He was part of the England squad at UEFA Euro 2012, and later that year was the first-choice goalkeeper for the Great Britain team at the Olympic tournament. He became the youngest goalkeeper to play for the senior England team when he made his debut in August 2012.\r\n\r\nButland was born in Bristol, and raised in nearby Clevedon where he attended Yeo Moor Primary School and Clevedon Community School. After playing for Clevedon United and the Bristol-based Jamie Shore Academy, he joined Birmingham City as a schoolboy in 2007 and began a two-year scholarship in the club's youth academy when he left school in 2009. During his time at school Butland was a keen rugby player. While still aged 16, Butland made his reserve team debut, and signed his first professional contract, of two-and-a-half years, as soon as he turned 17 in March 2010. Named Birmingham City's Young Player of the Year at the end of the 2009\u201310 season, his progress was interrupted in October 2010 by a broken hand requiring surgery. By the following April he had recovered well enough to be given a first-team squad number before the Premier League match against Wolverhampton Wanderers as cover, in case Ben Foster's injury or Colin Doyle's illness prevented either from taking part in the match.\r\n\r\nButland signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with Premier League club Stoke City on 31 January 2013. As part of the deal, he returned to Birmingham City on loan for the remainder of the season. According to Stoke, the fee was an initial \u00a33.3 million, rising to \u00a33.5m. On his return to Stoke for the 2013\u201314 season, he found himself third choice behind Asmir Begovi\u0107 and Thomas S\u00f8rensen, and on 26 September, he joined Championship club Barnsley on a three-month emergency loan. With Barnsley's only other fit goalkeeper an inexperienced 19-year-old, Butland went straight into the starting eleven for their next match, a 2\u20131 defeat at Leicester City in which he brought down Jamie Vardy to concede a penalty and was perhaps fortunate to receive only a yellow card. Butland made 13 appearances for Barnsley before being recalled by Stoke on 26 December 2013 after Asmir Begovi\u0107 suffered an injury. On 1 January 2014, Butland made his Premier League debut for the Potters, replacing injured keeper Thomas S\u00f8rensen at half time against Everton, the match ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Butland made his first league start on 12 January 2014 against Liverpool which ended in a 5\u20133 defeat.\r\n\r\nOn 20 February 2014, Butland joined Championship side Leeds United for the remainder of the 2013\u201314 season. Stoke manager Mark Hughes believed the move was important for Butland to gain more first team experience stating that; \"Now this opportunity to go to Leeds, where they have a big fanbase and big expectations will be another good step for him.\" With injury to Leeds' first choice keeper Paddy Kenny, Butland went straight into the first team and made his debut in a 0\u20130 draw with Middlesbrough, where he received the man of the match award. Butland had a tough time at Elland Road where he conceded 28 goals in 16 appearances as Leeds finished in 15th position.\r\n\r\nOn 20 October 2014 Butland joined Derby County on a one-month loan. He played six times for the Rams before returning to Stoke. Butland became back-up to Asmir Begovic in the 2014\u201315, playing in League Cup and FA Cup matches. Butland signed a contract extension with Stoke in March 2015 keeping him contracted at Stoke until the summer of 2019. Butland played in three matches in May 2015, keeping two clean sheets against Tottenham Hotspur and Burnley.\r\n\r\nFollowing the sale of Asmir Begovi\u0107, Butland was handed the number one shirt by Mark Hughes ahead of the 2015\u201316 season. Butland produced a man of the match performance in a 1\u20131 draw with Norwich City on 22 August 2015. On 27 October, in the fourth round of the League Cup, he saved from Eden Hazard as Stoke defeated Chelsea in a penalty shootout after a 1\u20131 home draw. Four days later, Butland was widely praised for another man of the match display as Stoke drew 0\u20130 against Newcastle United. In March 2016 Butland signed a long-term contract with the Potters keeping him contracted until the summer of 2021. He was an ever-present until 26 March, when he suffered a fractured ankle whilst playing for England against Germany, ruling him out for the remainder of the season. Butland made 35 appearances for Stoke in 2015\u201316 and his performances earned him the player of the year award.\r\n\r\nButland returned from injury in time for 2016\u201317 pre-season.\r\n\r\nIn January 2014 Butland had his car, an Audi RS5, stolen from his house in Walsall. In December 2015 Butland donated \u00a35,000 to the Great Britain women's deaf football team.",

Again he failed to establish himself and went out on loan to Hull City, Crewe Alexandra and Barnsley before joining Hull permanently.

    "strDescriptionEN": "Lee Anderson Grant (born 27 January 1983) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Stoke City in the Premier League.\r\n\r\nGrant began his professional career with Derby County, making his Football League debut in September 2002. Grant spent five seasons with Derby, during which time he went out on loan to Burnley and Oldham Athletic. He joined Sheffield Wednesday in July 2007 and established himself as first choice goalkeeper, playing in 136 consecutive matches. He moved to Burnley in July 2010, where he made 126 appearances in three seasons, before returning to Derby County in May 2013. Grant joined Stoke City in August 2016, initially on loan, before a permanent transfer in January 2017.\r\n\r\nGrant began his career at Watford in 1998 but failed to make an appearance for the Hertfordshire based club and Grant joined Derby County as a trainee in 2000 and made his debut for the Rams in the 2002\u201303 season in a Championship game against Burnley on 7 September 2002, replacing the injured Andy Oakes. He went on to win the club's Young Player of the Year award at the end of the season after playing a total of thirty games. By the end of the season Grant had established himself as a regular in the England youth set-up, and joined the under-21 team for a training session in Sardinia prior to the European Championship qualifying games against Serbia & Montenegro and Slovakia in June 2003.\r\n\r\nGrant finally made his debut for England under-21s on 9 September 2003 after Chris Kirkland injured himself during the pre-match warm-up prior to the European Championship qualifier against Portugal, and went on to make a further three appearances for the youth side. Meanwhile, a string of good performances for Derby following another injury to Andy Oakes earned him a three and a half-year contract extension on 29 January 2004. Grant was voted into fourth place in the fan's Player of the Year award at the end of the 2003\u201304 season.\r\n\r\nDerby's young 'keeper Lee Camp was given a chance during the 2004\u201305 pre-season after a highly successful loan spell at QPR the previous season. Camp impressed in the game and as a result Grant found himself on the bench at the start of the season despite his recent good form. The move led to press reports that Grant was surplus to requirements at Pride Park, however manager George Burley dismissed the story as \"total speculation with no basis in fact\". Around the same time, Grant also found himself ousted from the England under-21 squad by Camp.\r\n\r\nGrant would have to wait until 19 October to make his first appearance of the season for Derby, when he replaced Lee Camp in goal following Camp's sending-off against Wolves. Grant went on to start the following match against Burnley whilst Camp served a suspension for the red card, but would not play another first team game for the remainder of the season. Lee Camp sympathised with Grant at the time, saying: \"It's tough for Granty and I would be frustrated in his situation. He came in for the Burnley game and did nothing wrong but I think I've done enough this season to warrant my place in the side\". Grant's woes were added to when he suffered a wrist injury in training in March 2005. The injury was followed by a shoulder problem the following month which required surgery and kept the goalkeeper out of action for several months.\r\n\r\nGrant was given a chance by new Derby boss Phil Brown during the 2005\u201306 pre-season, but was again relegated to the bench by the start of the season. He played his first game of the season on 24 August 2005 as Derby crashed out of the League Cup at the hands of Grimsby Town. Another injury followed a fortnight later when Grant fractured his metatarsal during training, and was out of action for another two weeks.\r\n\r\nBorn in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, Grant is a Watford fan, and dreamt of playing for the club as a child.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Marc Mube Muniesa (born 27 March 1992) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for English club Stoke City. Mainly a central defender, he can also play as a left back.\r\n\r\nMuniesa began his career with Barcelona, making his debut at the end of the 2008\u201309 season at the age of 17. Muniesa then played for Barcelona B, helping them to win promotion to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n in 2009\u201310. He was on the verge of breaking into the first team in 2012\u201313 but suffered a torn knee ligament in pre-season and missed most of the season. In July 2013 he joined English side Stoke City on a free transfer.\r\n\r\nMuniesa gained 26 caps for Spain at youth level, including five for the under-21 side with which he won the 2013 European Championship.\r\n\r\nBorn in Lloret de Mar, Girona, Catalonia, when Muniesa was only 15 years old there were already transfer rumours that Chelsea wanted to sign him. At the La Masia youth academy he developed quickly, and was ready to appear for FC Barcelona's first team at the age of 17.\r\n\r\nMuniesa made his debut for Bar\u00e7a's first team aged 17 years and 57 days on 23 May 2009, as a substitute in a 1\u20130 La Liga home loss against CA Osasuna for the already crowned league champions. This appearance made him the second youngest player ever to feature for Barcelona, but he only played a few minutes, being sent off after a challenge on an opponent; the following Wednesday, he was named amongst the substitutes for the 2009 Champions League Final against Manchester United.\r\n\r\nMuniesa and four other FC Barcelona B players were promoted to the first team for the 2009\u201310 pre-season, but he appeared almost exclusively for the B's in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B, contributing with 19 games and one goal as the team returned to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n after 11 years. In 2010\u201311 Muniesa played 25 times for Barcelona B as they finished in 3rd position in Spain's second tier. In 2011\u201312 he made three substitute appearances for the first team, one in the league against Getafe CF and two in the UEFA Champions League, against FC BATE Borisov and Bayer 04 Leverkusen; he added 24 matches with the reserves, helping them to the eighth position in the table.\r\n\r\nOn 15 February 2011 Muniesa signed a new contract with Barcelona, extending his link with the club by another year and raising his buyout clause to \u20ac30 million. On 4 April of the following year the Blaugrana announced that the player had signed an extension to his contract, also being promoted to the main squad for the 2012\u201313 season.\r\n\r\nOn 24 July 2012, in Barcelona's first pre-season friendly, against Hamburger SV, Muniesa suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, going on to miss six months. Prior to suffering his injury Muniesa was wanted on loan by Dutch club Ajax.\r\n\r\nOn 2 July 2013 Muniesa joined Premier League club Stoke City on a free transfer, signing a four-year contract. Following his move to England he stated \u2014 \u201cI never imagined I would get the chance to play in the Premier League, but when Stoke called me I decided to come here with my family to speak to them. All the people I\u2019ve spoken have shown a lot of confidence in me and I\u2019m really happy that everything has been sorted. It wasn't a big decision for me to make. I came to England yesterday to meet the people at the club and look around the training ground, which is very impressive\". He made his debut for Stoke in a 3\u20131 victory over Walsall in the League Cup on 31 August 2013. He made his first start in the Premier League on 30 November 2013 against Everton at Goodison Park. Muniesa played 17 times for the club in 2013\u201314 as Stoke finished the season in 9th position. Throughout the campaign manager Mark Hughes mainly used Muniesa as back-up to Erik Pieters.\r\n\r\nMuniesa scored his first goals in English football on 23 September 2014, scoring both goals in a 2\u20131 League Cup third round victory over Sunderland. In December 2014 Munisea began playing alongside Ryan Shawcross at centre-back due to injury to Marc Wilson. He helped Stoke keep back-to-back clean sheets in victories over Everton and West Bromwich Albion. Muniesa remained a regular in Mark Hughes' team before he suffered a hamstring injury in February 2015 which ruled him out for six weeks. Muniesa recovered to play in the final few matches of the season, in total he played 22 times for Stoke in 2014\u201315 as the Potters finished in 9th position for a second season running and they ended the campaign with a 6\u20131 victory against Liverpool.\r\n\r\nOn 7 August 2015 Muniesa signed a new contract with Stoke keeping him at the club until the summer of 2019. He had his attempt saved by Simon Mignolet as Stoke lost in a penalty shootout to Liverpool, missing out on the 2016 Football League Cup Final. His season was disrupted by injury, playing in 17 matches as Stoke again finished in 9th position.\r\n\r\nMuniesa played in all of Spain's youth teams from under-16s to under 21s. During that time he has been members of the squads which won the 2013 European Under-21 Championship and achieved a third-place finish at the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup.\r\n\r\nMuniesa is a defender and has played at centre back and left back and can also play as a defensive midfielder but states that his preferred position is at centre back. \"My favourite position is central defender. I can also play at left back or in midfield but I feel better when I play centre back\".",

He was capped 42 times by the England national team from 2005 to 2010, scoring 22 goals for his country in that time, and appearing at two World Cups.\r\n\r\nCrouch started his career as a trainee with Tottenham Hotspur. He failed to make an appearance for Spurs and after loan spells at Dulwich Hamlet and Swedish club IFK H\u00e4ssleholm he joined Queens Park Rangers. QPR were relegated at the end of the 2000\u201301 season and Portsmouth stepped in and paid \u00a31.5 million for Crouch. He had a good season at Fratton Park and after scoring 19 goals he joined Aston Villa in March 2002 for \u00a35 million. He had a relatively poor spell at Villa and was loaned out to Norwich City in 2003 before making a move to Southampton where he re-gained his form and was signed by Liverpool in July 2005.\r\n\r\nAt Liverpool, Crouch enjoyed considerable success, winning the FA Community Shield and FA Cup in 2006 and also gained a runners-up medal in the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final.

Although born in England, Bardsley qualifies for Scotland through his Glasgow-born father.\r\n\r\nBardsley began his career with Manchester United where he made 18 appearances in five seasons at the club. During that time, he was loaned to several clubs, including Royal Antwerp, Burnley, Rangers, Aston Villa and Sheffield United.\r\n\r\nHe joined Sunderland in January 2008 for an initial fee of \u00a3850,000. Bardsley established himself as a regular at the Stadium of Light under Steve Bruce and Martin O'Neill and he won the player of the year award in 2010\u201311. He lost his place in the team in 2012\u201313 after a falling-out with manager Paolo Di Canio, before returning to the first team under Gus Poyet. Under Poyet, Bardsley helped Sunderland to avoid relegation in 2013\u201314 and reach the 2014 Football League Cup Final, in which they lost 3\u20131 to Manchester City.\r\n\r\nAfter his Sunderland contract expired in June 2014, Bardsley joined Stoke City on a free transfer.\r\n\r\nBardsley attended Hope High School in his hometown, Salford, along with former United team-mates Mark Redshaw and Mark Howard. Bardsley started his career with Charlestown Lads Club also with Redshaw before signing for Manchester United. He grew up near Manchester United's old training ground, The Cliff, and would often go there on his school holidays to see the players train. Prior to his departure for Sunderland, he was the only current player who progressed through all the levels of the academy, starting out at the club at the age of 8.\r\n\r\nOn 6 October 2010, Bardsley received a call-up for the Scotland national team for the Euro 2012 qualifier against the Czech Republic on 8 October 2010. He qualifies because his father was born in Glasgow. He made his debut on 11 October 2010 in a 3\u20132 defeat by World and European champions Spain, filling in for the injured Alan Hutton.\r\n\r\nBardsley plays at right back and describes himself as a modern full-back.\u2014 \"Since I started playing professionally, the game has changed and you have to be really, really fit because a full-back is expected to get up and down the pitch. I like to defend and be aggressive, but also get forward to create chances and create goals, it's all part of being a modern-day full-back.\"\r\n\r\nBardsley married glamour model Tanya Robinson in 2014, with whom he has three children.",

He joined Stoke City on loan in August 2007 and made an instant impact scoring on his debut against Cardiff City. His good form prompted Stoke to pay Manchester United \u00a31 million in January 2008 to keep him at the Britannia Stadium. He formed a good defensive partnership with Leon Cort as Stoke gained promotion to the Premier League for the first time, ending 23 years away from the top flight.\r\n\r\nDespite making a bad start to Premier League football, Shawcross established himself as first-choice centre-back along with Abdoulaye Faye. Stoke comfortably stayed up, and after another mid-table finish in 2009\u201310, Shawcross was handed the Captain's armband by manager Tony Pulis ahead of the 2010\u201311 season. With Faye drifting out of the side, Robert Huth became Shawcross's defensive partner and the team reached the 2011 FA Cup Final, finishing runners-up to Manchester City. The run to the final also meant that Stoke entered the UEFA Europa League in 2011\u201312, and they reached the round of 32 losing to Spanish side Valencia. Shawcross continued to be a regular under Pulis in 2012\u201313 and then under Mark Hughes in 2013\u201314 which saw him win the player of the year award.",

Berahino joined West Bromwich Albion at the age of 11 and turned professional seven years later. He spent time out on loan at Football League clubs Northampton Town, Brentford and Peterborough United; the latter two spells were ended prematurely by a feud with his manager Uwe R\u00f6sler, and a knee injury, respectively.\r\n\r\nBerahino made his first starts for West Bromwich Albion in the 2013\u201314 season, with highlights of that campaign including a hat-trick against Newport County, and the winning goal at Old Trafford against Manchester United. In his second full season, he recorded 20 goals in 45 games across all competitions. Following that successful campaign, Berahino became involved in a lengthy transfer saga involving Tottenham Hotspur, straining his relationships with manager Tony Pulis and West Bromwich Albion chairman Jeremy Peace.\r\n\r\nBerahino represented England at all youth levels from under-16 to under-21, and was part of their under-17 team which won the 2010 European Championship.

    "strDescriptionEN": "S\u00e9amus John James \"Shay\" Given (born 20 April 1976) is an Irish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Stoke City and the Republic of Ireland national team.\r\n\r\nHaving surpassed the total of 100 caps required for membership, he is part of the FIFA Century Club. Given gained his first international cap in 1996 and played in goal during every match for his country during the 2002 FIFA World Cup campaign, helping them reach the knockout stage. He was later on the pitch in Paris when the Republic of Ireland were knocked out of the play-offs for a spot in the 2010 FIFA World Cup by France before helping his team qualify for UEFA Euro 2012. He was selected in Martin O'Neill's 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016 but didn't appear in any of Ireland's four matches at the tournament. Given is the second most capped Republic of Ireland player (after Robbie Keane). He holds 134 caps and has kept 52 clean sheets as of June 2016.\r\n\r\nGiven started his career at Celtic, however he never made a first-team appearance and he was released and signed by Blackburn Rovers on a free transfer in 1994. Given was part of both the Sunderland team who won the Football League First Division title in 1995\u201396 and the Swindon Town team who won the Football League Second Division title that same season, while on loan from Blackburn Rovers. He was signed by Newcastle United in 1997 for a fee of \u00a31.5 million, and it was there that he began competing to be a first-choice Premier League goalkeeper. Given was part of the teams who came runners-up in the 1998 and 1999 FA Cup campaigns, and was named in the Premier League Team of the Season for 2001\u201302 and 2005\u201306. He played in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup with Newcastle, and was involved in the club's title challenge in 2001\u201302. Although he submitted a transfer request during the 2000\u201301 campaign after losing his position in the starting line-up, it was denied, and Given went on to regain his place.\r\n\r\nOn 1 February 2009, Given transferred to Manchester City for \u00a36 million on a four-and-a-half-year contract. While Given was at Manchester City, the club qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in its history after finishing third in the Premier League, as well as winning the FA Cup, though he did not appear in the league in the campaign that City reached the Champions League, nor did he play in the FA Cup. On 18 July 2011, he joined Aston Villa for a fee believed to be around \u00a33.5 million, signing a five-year contract. Four years later, Given joined Stoke City in July 2015.\r\n\r\nBorn in Lifford, County Donegal, Given's footballing career began at local amateur side Lifford Celtic where he shot to notoriety for conceding seven goals on his debut. He was propelled into the limelight when he played in the Football Association of Ireland's Junior Cup for Lifford Celtic in the semi-final in Dundalk. At 14, his performances for the club attracted attention from Celtic, and he was invited to train with their youth side during a pre-season tour of Ireland in 1991. Given signed for the club a year later. Despite being named to the substitutes bench for the Old Firm derby against Rangers on 1 January 1994, Given never made a first-team appearance.\r\n\r\nHis performances for Celtic's youth team did bring him to the attention of Blackburn Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish, and he signed for the English side on a free transfer in the summer of 1994.\r\n\r\nGiven represented the Republic of Ireland at youth level before earning five caps for the Republic of Ireland national under-21 team. Although he did not become a regular first team player for Blackburn Rovers, Given's performances while on loan at Swindon and Sunderland led to him being called up to the Republic of Ireland squad in 1996. He made his debut for the national team on 27 March 1996, in a game against Russia. Although Ireland failed to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup or UEFA Euro 2000, Given established himself as first-choice goalkeeper. He played in all of his nation's games at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. With draws against Cameroon and Germany and a 3\u20130 win against Saudi Arabia, the team reached the second round of the competition. Meeting Spain in the knockout round, Ireland forced penalties with the score at 1\u20131 at the end of extra time. Three missed penalties for Ireland ended their participation in the tournament, and Spain progressed to the next round.\r\n\r\nGiven was part of the team for most of the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign; however a draw with Switzerland meant Ireland failed to qualify for the finals of the competition in Germany. He equalled Packie Bonner's record of 80 caps against Slovakia on 28 March 2007. Given obtained his 100th cap against Montenegro at Croke Park, Dublin on 14 October 2009 in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying game. Ireland reached a qualifying play-off against France, but were controversially eliminated by a goal scored after Thierry Henry handled the ball.\r\n\r\nGiven was part of the team that secured qualification for UEFA Euro 2012 with a play-off victory against Estonia. Given played in the Euro 2012 championship as Ireland were eliminated in the group stage.\r\n\r\nHe gives all his international playing fees to charity.\r\n\r\nGiven married Jane Cunningham in Hexham, England, in a Catholic ceremony in 2001. They have two children Shayne and Sienna. The couple divorced on 17 June 2014. Given has been in a relationship with Manchester-based PR executive Becky Gibson since 2013, who is expecting the couple's first child.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Given was awarded the Freedom of County Donegal in a ceremony in his home town, Lifford. He follows the Donegal Gaelic football team and witnessed their first All-Ireland success in 1992.\r\n\r\nGiven has also helped organise several successful fundraising events, in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support. His mother died of cancer when he was five, so he has continually tried to raise money as it is an issue close to him.\r\n\r\nOn 27 November 2011, Given was brought to tears during a minute's applause for former team-mate and personal friend Gary Speed, following Speed's suicide earlier that day, before Aston Villa met Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Adnan Januzaj (Albanian pronunciation: ; born 5 February 1995) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a winger for English club Sunderland, on loan from Manchester United, and the Belgium national team. Born and raised in Brussels, he began his career with Anderlecht before joining Manchester United in 2011 at the age of 16. Januzaj made his full international debut in 2014 and later that year played for Belgium at the World Cup.\r\n\r\nJanuzaj was born in Brussels, Belgium, where his Kosovar-Albanian family had migrated in 1992 so his father, Abedin, could avoid being recruited by the Yugoslav People's Army. Januzaj's father was the eldest of six children from Istok, Kosovo. Januzaj's uncles, Januz and Shemsedin, were members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which fought for Kosovar independence during the Kosovo War. Januzaj's mother's family had been deported to Turkey by Yugoslav authorities under a plan to suppress Albanian nationalism. Since Kosovo declared independence in 2008, Januzaj has regularly visited his extended family there during the summer.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, media rumored Januzaj was eligible to represent teams other than Belgium (through being born there and having a Belgian passport), Kosovo (non-FIFA member at that time and a partially recognized independence state) and Serbia (since Kosovo's independence was partially recognized), including Turkey and Albania. About this case, Abedin Januzaj (Adnan's father) revealed:\u201cI am not closing the doors to Albania, because we are Albanian (Adnan Januzaj's parents). However, they are closing the doors to themselves. I only deal with professionals on the issue.\u201d and Adnan would not represent Serbia, Turkey and Croatia because \u201cwe have no connections with these countries\u201d. In October 2013, also England manager Roy Hodgson stated that The Football Association was monitoring the player with a view to calling him up if Januzaj was naturalized as a British citizen (and passed the residency requirement of FIFA, according to David Moyes). However, despite widespread press coverage, Januzaj would not meet the requirements to play for England under the unique rules set out in the Home Nations agreement. The Home Nations agreement requires that players engage in a minimum of five years of education before the age of 18 within the territory of the relevant association and do not offer national team eligibility through residency.\r\n\r\nAccording to FIFA eligibility rules, which mostly based on jus soli (eligible to represent place of birth), a limited jus sanguinis (eligible to represent parent and grandparent's POB) and naturalization by residency, despite Januzaj's maternal family had Turkish passports, they were not born in the territory of Turkey. For Albania, despite Januzaj was eligible to have an Albania passport through naturalization, it was uncertain that he had parental or maternal parent and grandparent born in the modern border of Albania, in order to make him eligible. Lastly, Januzaj did not have a British passport, nor a 5-year residency, thus even without Home Nations agreement, he is not eligible.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, New Balance announced that they were taking over Warrior Sports, and they would be intent on making their own football boots. They recruited many professional footballers, including Januzaj, who also featured in an advertisement promoting the new range.",

He was selected for his national squad at the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario. Oviedo has previously represented Saprissa, FC Copenhagen and Nordsj\u00e6lland.\r\n\r\nOn 31 August 2012, Oviedo signed for English Premier League side Everton for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut as an 85th-minute substitute during a 3\u20130 away league win over Swansea City in September. Oviedo was very much a squad player during his first season with Everton as he made 15 league appearances, 14 of those as a substitute. In 2012, in a starting 11 against Norwich City, Oviedo picked up his first assist for the club. He scored his first goal for Everton on 30 November 2013 in a 4\u20130 win over Stoke City, also picking up an assist. Four days later he scored against Manchester United in the 86th minute in a 1\u20130 win, leading Everton to their first win at Old Trafford in 21 years.\r\n\r\nOn 25 January 2014, Oviedo suffered a broken left leg 18 minutes into the Stevenage vs Everton FA Cup Fourth Round tie. He sustained the injury from a tackle on Stevenage midfielder Simon Heslop, a clean break to both his tibia and fibula.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the game, speaking to BT Sport, Everton manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez said \"A real negative today is the unfortunate incident and we need to give Bryan as much support as we can now. He's had a terrific season and I've been very impressed with him. He's an important player in the group and he deserves a speedy recovery. The injury to Bryan affected everyone. Those type of injuries leave a sick taste.\" Everton later confirmed that Oviedo would require surgery to heal a double fracture of his left leg. In May 2014, Oviedo said he was unable to recover from his injury in time to be ready for the 2014 World Cup with his national team.\r\n\r\nOviedo returned from injury on 23 September in Everton's 3\u20130 defeat at Swansea City in the second round of the League Cup; he started the match before being replaced after 58 minutes by James McCarthy.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Darron Thomas Daniel Gibson (born 25 October 1987) is an Irish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for English club Sunderland and the Republic of Ireland national team. He has also played for Manchester United and on loan for Royal Antwerp and Wolverhampton Wanderers.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Gibson, who was born and raised in Derry, Northern Ireland, was at the centre of a dispute between the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) and the Irish Football Association (IFA), after he opted to play for the Republic of Ireland instead of Northern Ireland. The issue was referred to FIFA and was discussed in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The issue was settled in 2010 when it was declared, as Irish citizens, Northern Ireland-born people are entitled to play for either the Republic or Northern Ireland. Gibson represented Ireland at UEFA Euro 2012.\r\n\r\nOn 13 January 2012, Gibson signed for Everton for an undisclosed fee. He became the fourth ex-United player to sign for Everton under David Moyes, following Phil Neville, Tim Howard and Louis Saha. He made his debut a day later, as he started in a 1\u20131 draw with Aston Villa. Later that month, Gibson scored his first goal for the club in a 1\u20130 home win against league leaders Manchester City. Gibson played 11 times in the league during his first season with the club and didn't finish on the losing side once. If his time at Manchester United is taken into account this figure is stretched to 28 consecutive league games without defeat. The run came to an end in Everton's third league game of the 2012\u201313 season, when Gibson started in a 0\u20132 loss to West Bromwich Albion, although the game was level at 0\u20130 when Gibson was substituted in the first half due to injury. Gibson was sent off for the first time in his career, in a 1\u20132 win away to West Ham United on 22 December 2012, although the red card and subsequent ban were rescinded by The Football Association five days later. On 13 April 2013, Gibson scored his first goal of the season in a 2\u20130 home win against Queens Park Rangers. His impact on Everton in his first two seasons was such that the club won 52% of the games he played in and only 25% of those he did not, with Gibson being hailed as the key link between attack and defence.\r\n\r\nGibson only made one league appearance during the 2013\u201314 season as it was ended in October when he suffered serious cruciate knee ligament damage whilst on international duty.\r\n\r\nGibson was at the centre of a dispute between the Irish Football Association (IFA) and the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) over the eligibility of players born within Northern Ireland to represent the Republic of Ireland. The general principle or article 5 of FIFA's Regulations Governing the Application of the Statutes states that \"any person holding a permanent nationality that is not dependent on residence in a certain country is eligible to play for the representative teams of the Association of that country\". Due to the constitutional position of Northern Ireland following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, citizenship of the Republic of Ireland is the undisputed birthright of every person born on the island of Ireland if they so wish, so long as at least one parent is an Irish or British citizen or, failing that, a permanent resident. As a result, Gibson was approached to represent both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland at international level.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Jack Christian Rodwell (born 11 March 1991) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Sunderland. Rodwell joined Everton's academy at the age of seven, and made his debut in 2007. He spent five years in the first team before he transferred to Premier League champions Manchester City in 2012. After making only 16 league appearances in two seasons, Rodwell was sold to Sunderland in August 2014.\r\n\r\nRodwell has represented England at all levels from under-16 to the senior team. He made his senior international debut as a substitute in a 1\u20130 win over Spain at Wembley Stadium in November 2011.\r\n\r\nRodwell was born in Southport, Merseyside. He was educated at Farnborough Road Junior School and Birkdale High School, and was an avid supporter of Everton as a child. Rodwell played for local club Birkdale United during his school years.\r\n\r\nRodwell joined the Everton youth system at the age of seven, making his under-18s debut at 14 and his debut for Everton's reserve team at the age of 15. Rodwell then broke a record on his senior debut becoming the youngest player to represent Everton in Europe, when he came on as a substitute against Dutch team AZ at the age of 16 years and 284 days. At youth level Rodwell often played as a centre back but in stepping up to the senior side began to play in midfield. In March 2008, he appeared as a substitute on his Premier League debut \u2013 before also featuring as a replacement in the final match of the season, replacing Tim Cahill in a 1\u20130 victory over Sunderland which he scored in, and signed his first professional contract with Everton on 17 March 2008, after spending six years in the reserve team. He made his first professional start against Blackburn Rovers on 16 August 2008, playing the full 90 minutes. Rodwell scored his first senior goal for Everton in the FA Cup against Aston Villa in February 2009. That same month, he signed a five-year contract with Everton.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the 2009\u201310 season, Rodwell earned his first start in European competition in a UEFA Europa League match against Czech Republic side Sigma Olomouc. Rodwell marked the occasion by scoring two long-range goals, helping Everton to a 4\u20130 win. He scored his first Premier League goal in Everton's 3\u20131 win against Manchester United. At the end of the season Rodwell signed a five-year contract extension with Everton. Although Rodwell is primarily deployed as a defensive midfielder, he was regarded as having the potential to become a top centre back early in his professional career. During the second half of the 2009\u201310 season, Rodwell became regularly employed in more attacking midfield positions. Rodwell was sent off in the 23rd minute, during the 216th Merseyside derby on 1 October 2011 after making \"what appeared to be a legitimate challenge on Su\u00e1rez\", according to the BBC.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Jan Tilman Kirchhoff (German pronunciation: ; born 1 October 1990) is a German professional footballer who plays as a centre-back and defensive midfielder for Sunderland.\r\n\r\nKirchhoff made his professional debut in the 2. Bundesliga for 1. FSV Mainz 05 on 2 November 2008, when he started in a game against Rot Weiss Ahlen. He has been regarded as one of the most talented defenders in the Bundesliga.\r\n\r\nOn 4 January 2013, Kirchoff signed a pre-contract with Bayern Munich, agreeing to join them for the 2013\u201314 season as a free agent.\r\n\r\nOn 27 December 2013, Kirchhoff joined fellow Bundesliga side Schalke 04 on a one-and-a-half year loan until 30 June 2015.\r\n\r\nOn 7 January 2016, Kirchhoff signed an 18-month contract with Sunderland for an undisclosed fee. On 16 January 2016, Kirchhoff made his debut for Sunderland as a 59th-minute substitute. Kirchhoff made a poor start as he deflected a shot from Christian Eriksen which led to a goal, and conceded a penalty with a foul on Danny Rose. The German was then deployed mainly as a defensive midfielder and earned plaudits due to his precise tackling and passing. Kirchhoff was voted the PFA Fans' Player of the Month for April for his performances as Sunderland fought against relegation. Kirchhoff's efforts paid off as Sunderland managed to survive relegation thanks to a 3\u20130 win over Everton on 11 May 2016 with goals coming from defenders Patrick van Aanholt and a brace from Lamine Kon\u00e9.\r\n\r\nOn 13 November 2007, Kirchhoff debuted for the Germany national U18 football team coming on in the 72nd minute of the match in a 4\u20130 win over Republic of Ireland U18s. On 7 September 2008, he debuted for the Germany national U19 football team in a 5\u20130 win over Czech Republic U19s. Kirchhoff scored his first U19 goal on 11 October 2008 in the 55th-minute of the match in a 5\u20130 win over Lithuania U19s. On 3 September 2009, he debuted for the Germany U21s in a 1\u20131 draw against Czech Republic U21s and scored his first U21 goal in the 72nd-minute. In 2012, Kirchhoff participated with the U21 team as an important squad member and the team's vice-captain in the 2013 UEFA European U21 Championship qualification, but due to injury he could not take part in the 2013 UEFA European U21 Championship.\r\n\r\nKirchhoff's brother Benjamin Kirchhoff is also a professional football defender who plays for VfB Stuttgart II. Kirchhoff's father Theo Kirchhoff is a former footballer who played for German club VfL Germania Leer.",

He has also represented Northern Ireland at under-17, under-19 and under-21 levels.\r\n\r\nMcNair was first discovered by Manchester United's Northern Ireland-based scout, Tony Coulter, when McNair was 12, and began travelling to train with United during his school holidays. He eventually signed for the club in 2011, having impressed the club scouts in a midfield role for Ballyclare Colts, but was later converted into a defender by United youth coach Paul McGuinness. While making the transition from midfield to defence, McNair was frequently compared to Michael Carrick by McGuinness.\r\n\r\nOn 4 November 2014, McNair was called up to the Northern Ireland senior team for the first time, ahead of a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match away to Romania, but did not play. He made his debut on 25 March 2015 in a friendly against Scotland at Hampden Park, playing the entirety of a 1\u20130 defeat. He made his competitive debut on 4 September 2015 in a 3\u20131 away win over the Faroe Islands in a European qualifier.\r\n\r\nOn 8 October 2015, McNair was drafted into the starting line-up for a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier match against Greece. Northern Ireland went on to secure a decisive 3-1 victory, qualifying for the competition, a first major tournament the team would have qualified for in thirty years. After the final qualifying match, a 1\u20131 away draw with Finland on 11 October 2015, McNair remained in a Helsinki hospital due to concerns of a ruptured liver.\r\n\r\nOn 24 March 2016, McNair was selected in the starting line-up for an international friendly against Wales, which subsequently ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Notably, McNair was deployed in a holding midfielder role instead of his more conventional position as a central defender. Following his display in the match, Northern Ireland head coach, Michael O'Neill, \"believes midfield could be where McNair's future lies\".\r\n\r\nOn 18 May 2016, McNair was selected as part of the provisional 27-man squad to represent Northern Ireland in the UEFA Euro 2016 competition.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Steven Jerome Pienaar (Dutch pronunciation: ; born 17 March 1982) is a South African professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Sunderland, and was captain of the South African national team until October 2012. He primarily plays as a winger, but can also play on either the right or left wing and as an attacking midfielder. Pienaar has previously played for Ajax Cape Town, Ajax, Borussia Dortmund, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur.\r\n\r\nPienaar was born in Johannesburg. He started his professional career at Ajax Cape Town, some 1,400 kilometres (870 mi) away from his home in Johannesburg. He was brought to the attention of Ajax CT whilst playing for the School of Excellence and was asked to join their youth academy.\r\n\r\nPienaar said, \"I was very fortunate to go to the School of Excellence 2000, to be able to polish the technique and the talent that God gave me and to learn how to use it in the way that God had wanted me to.\" \"I was fortunate to work with the Dutch coach Leo van Veen, who helped me at Ajax Cape Town... He appreciated the way I played but at the same time he changed my mentality. He taught me how to prepare for games, not just playing to please the crowd but also how to play for the team.\"\r\n\r\nAt Ajax Cape Town, he won the Rothman's Cup after beating Orlando Pirates 4\u20131 in the final on 13 December 2000, his final game for the club.\r\n\r\nAged 18, Pienaar was brought over to the Netherlands in January 2001 but did not make his Eredivisie debut until 24 February 2002, a 1\u20130 victory over NAC Breda. He became a pivotal member of the Ajax team that won the Dutch League in 2002 and 2004, shining as one of Ajax's best players alongside Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, Maxwell, Cristian Chivu, Mido, Nigel de Jong, Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder and future Everton teammate John Heitinga. Andy van der Meyde, who had a forgettable stint at Goodison Park, was also in that squad.",

In summer 2007, he signed for Swansea City in the English League One on a one-year performance-related deal, for an undisclosed fee \u2013 countryman Roberto Mart\u00ednez was the team's manager.\r\n\r\nIn his first season with Swansea, Rangel played a massive role as the Welsh returned to the Championship after a 24-year absence, as league champions. On 27 November 2007, he scored his first goal as a Swan, netting eight minutes from time in a 1\u20130 home win against Hartlepool United; only two weeks later, again at the Liberty Stadium, he netted in a 3\u20130 success over Southend United; in April 2008, he was one of five team players to make the PFA League One Team of the Year, alongside Ferrie Bodde, Garry Monk, Andy Robinson and the league's top scorer Jason Scotland.\r\n\r\nOn 5 September 2008, Rangel signed a new contract until June 2010. He continued to feature prominently in the following years and, in mid-February 2010, agreed to an extension until June 2011.\r\n\r\n2010\u201311 was a successful one for both Swansea and Rangel, as the former were promoted to the Premier League for the first time in their history following a 4\u20132 victory over Reading in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium. In spite of missing several weeks at the start of the campaign with a thigh muscle tear, he contributed to the feat with two goals from 41 appearances, scoring against Doncaster Rovers (1\u20131, away) and Millwall (1\u20131); in late June 2011, he put pen to paper to a new three-year deal.\r\n\r\nIn November 2011, Rangel was voted best defender in the Premier League. He played 34 games during the season, helping the team retain their league status.\r\n\r\nRangel scored his first goal in the English top flight on 25 August 2012, in a 3\u20130 home win against West Ham United. On 8 March 2013, he signed a new contract with Swansea, keeping him at the club until 2016.\r\n\r\nOn 19 April 2015, one month after again extending his link, now until 2017, Rangel was selected in the The Football Manager Team of the Decade at the Football League Awards.\r\n\r\nOn 18 January 2013, Rangel drove round Swansea with his wife Nikki to distribute food to the homeless. He told CNN: \"We went for something to eat in a local sandwich chain and overheard the manager saying they had to throw out food as they were about to close for the night. My wife, Nikki, who is a very caring and charitable person, asked if we could have them for the homeless rather than see them thrown in the bin. They agreed and we drove around Swansea for over an hour, but couldn't find any homeless people as it was so cold out on the streets with all the snow. We decided to tweet a plea and we were guided to a local charity shelter who looked after the homeless.\" He was so pleased with the reaction to his gesture he confirmed that he would be helping out again.\r\n\r\nOn 5 April 2013, Rangel announced plans to hold charity auctions with his wife and teammates Chico Flores, Ben Davies, Jonathan de Guzm\u00e1n, Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez, Michu and Itay Shechter, to raise money for the Severn Hospice in Telford, Maggie\u2019s Cancer Centre in Swansea and The Christian Lewis Trust Kids Cancer Charity \u2013 among the top prizes on offer at one of the auctions were Rangel\u2019s personal box for the game against Manchester City, and a visit to a Formula One garage during qualifying of the German Grand Prix. He was inspired to do this by Nikki, who has had three family members diagnosed with cancer.",

He began as a goalkeeper, the position which his father played professionally, but he converted him to a forward so that he could enjoy the game more. He made his senior debuts in the 2009\u201310 season, scoring 12 goals for the reserve team in the third division.\r\n\r\nOn 15 May 2010, in the campaign's last round, Borja made his first-team and La Liga debut, coming on as a substitute for Tiago in the 58th minute of the game against Getafe CF. Twenty minutes later, however, he was stretchered off with a serious anterior cruciate ligament injury on his left knee, in an eventual 0\u20133 home loss.\r\n\r\nSeven months after his injury, Borja re-appeared with Atl\u00e9tico B, as a substitute in a 1\u20130 win over CP Cacere\u00f1o. After the match, he stated: \"I'm very happy. I've passed really bad times and I've suffered, but now I'm prepared to help the team go up in the league table.\"\r\n\r\nOn 11 August 2016, Swansea City signed Borja on a 4 year contract from Atl\u00e8tico Madrid for a club record fee of \u00a315.5 million.\r\n\r\nBorja represented Spain's under-17 at the 2009 FIFA World Cup in Nigeria. As the national team finally finished in third position he won the Golden Boot with five goals, with teammate Sergi Roberto adding three.\r\n\r\nWith the under-19 team, Borja won the 2011 UEFA European Championship in Romania, but was a support player in a side favouring \u00c1lvaro Morata and Juanmi.\r\n\r\nBorja's father, Miguel Bast\u00f3n, was also a footballer. A goalkeeper, he also played with Atl\u00e9tico \u2013 but only with its reserves \u2013 and spent most of his career with Real Burgos CF.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Federico Fern\u00e1ndez (Spanish pronunciation: ; born 21 February 1989) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a central defender for Swansea City.\r\n\r\nHe began his career at Estudiantes de La Plata, where he reached the final of the Copa Sudamericana and won the Copa Libertadores, before moving to Napoli in 2011. He was used sparingly by the Serie A club, and spent time on loan at Getafe CF, before joining Swansea in 2014.\r\n\r\nFern\u00e1ndez made his full international debut in 2011 and has since earned over 30 international caps, scoring 3 goals. He was part of the Argentine squad which reached the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final.\r\n\r\nFederico has Italian origins: his maternal great-grandfather was a native of Lacedonia, in the Province of Avellino,. As a result, he has an Italian passport.\r\n\r\nFern\u00e1ndez made his league debut for Estudiantes on 14 September 2008 during the Apertura 2008 tournament in a 1\u20130 defeat to V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield. He played two games in Estudiantes' run to the final of Copa Sudamericana 2008.\r\n\r\nFern\u00e1ndez scored his first goal with the squad in an away match against Lan\u00fas, on 2 May 2009, following an assist by teammate Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n. Later that year Estudiantes won Copa Libertadores 2009, although Fern\u00e1ndez' only contributions were two substitute appearances against Defensor Sporting Club in the quarter finals.\r\n\r\nHe was signed by Serie A club Napoli in December 2010 for a reported fee of about \u20ac2.5 million. But due to the lack of a European Union passport, he arrived in Italy in July 2011.\r\n\r\nOn 2 November 2011, Fern\u00e1ndez scored his first two goals for Napoli against Bayern Munich in a Champions League group stage away tie. Both headers came after Napoli had conceded 3 times in the first half. Napoli lost the match 3\u20132.\r\n\r\nHaving only made 9 appearances across all competitions for Napoli that season, on 31 January 2013 Fern\u00e1ndez was loaned to La Liga club Getafe CF for the remainder of the campaign, bolstering the club's defence following the sale of David Abraham to Hoffenheim.\r\n\r\nFern\u00e1ndez played the full 90 minutes of the 2014 Coppa Italia Final, which Napoli won 3\u20131 against Fiorentina.\r\n\r\nOn 20 August 2014, it was announced that Fern\u00e1ndez had signed for Premier League side Swansea City on a four-year contract for 10 million euros. Six days later he made his debut for the club, playing the entirety of a 1\u20130 win over Rotherham United in the second round of the League Cup. His first league appearance for Swansea was on 13 September, replacing Jordi Amat at half time in a 4\u20132 defeat away to Chelsea.\r\n\r\nFern\u00e1ndez was given a straight red card for a foul on Philippe Coutinho in added time at the end of Swansea's League Cup fourth round game against Liverpool at Anfield on 28 October; minutes later Dejan Lovren scored the winner to knock Swansea out of the tournament. However, two days later, the FA rescinded the red card on appeal from Swansea, thus avoiding a three-match ban for Fern\u00e1ndez. He scored his first goal for Swansea City on the 19th of March 2016 in a 1-0 victory over Aston Villa at the Liberty Stadium.",

Il \u00e9volue au poste d'attaquant au FC Lorient.\r\n\r\nIl poss\u00e8de \u00e9galement la nationalit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise.\r\n\r\nFils d'Abedi Pel\u00e9, Jordan Ayew d\u00e9cide de marcher sur les traces de son p\u00e8re et de son fr\u00e8re a\u00een\u00e9 Andr\u00e9 Ayew en int\u00e9grant le centre de formation de l'Olympique de Marseille.\r\n\r\nLe 16 d\u00e9cembre 2009, il joue son premier match professionnel face au FC Lorient durant lequel il entre en jeu \u00e0 la 63e minute \u00e0 la place de Fernando Morientes. Il marque son premier but en \u00e9quipe premi\u00e8re lors du m\u00eame match. Ayew d\u00e9clare au terme de sa premi\u00e8re prestation avec l'\u00e9quipe professionnelle : \u00ab C'est une journ\u00e9e tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9ciale pour moi et ma famille, mon fr\u00e8re, pour les gens au Ghana, pour le centre de formation aussi. [...] Je suis tr\u00e8s content \u00bb. Il sera ainsi automatiquement champion de France avec l'OM en 2009-2010 malgr\u00e9 son faible temps de jeu (50 minutes sur l'ensemble de la saison).\r\n\r\nAu d\u00e9but de la saison 2010-2011, Jordan Ayew obtient beaucoup plus de temps de jeu et se r\u00e9v\u00e8le encore plus au grand public. Le 30 janvier 2011, il est titularis\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois en championnat lors de la rencontre face \u00e0 l'AS Monaco (0-0), durant laquelle il est remplac\u00e9 par Charles Kabor\u00e9 \u00e0 l'heure de jeu.\r\n\r\nLe 27 avril 2011, il confirme les espoirs plac\u00e9s en lui lors de la 32e journ\u00e9e de Ligue 1 contre l'OGC Nice (4-2). En effet, entr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'heure de jeu sur le terrain alors que le score est de 1-1, il offre une passe d\u00e9cisive \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re a\u00een\u00e9 Andr\u00e9, qui marque d'ailleurs un tripl\u00e9 durant ce match, et inscrit un but d'une superbe frappe enroul\u00e9e du pied droit.\r\n\r\nLe 23 ao\u00fbt 2012 en Ligue Europa contre le Sheriff Tiraspol, lors du match aller en Moldavie, alors que le score \u00e9tait de 0 \u00e0 0, il inscrit ses deux premiers buts en Coupe d'Europe, offre la victoire \u00e0 l'Olympique de Marseille (1-2) et lui permet d'acc\u00e9der aux phases de poules, le match retour s'\u00e9tant sold\u00e9 par un 0-0.\r\n\r\nLors de la p\u00e9riode estivale de transferts en 2012, il est un temps question du pr\u00eat ou du transfert de Jordan Ayew vers un club anglais (Reading, Stoke City) ou fran\u00e7ais (OGC Nice). Toutefois, une fois la date limite des transferts d\u00e9pass\u00e9e (04/09/2012), Jordan Ayew reste \u00e0 l'Olympique de Marseille7. Lors de la saison 2012-2013 il inscrit 7 buts en Ligue 1 et 10 buts toutes comp\u00e9titions confondues.\r\n\r\nLe 6 janvier 2014, Jordan Ayew est officiellement pr\u00eat\u00e9 par l'Olympique de Marseille au FC Sochaux jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de la saison. Malgr\u00e9 de bonnes performances, il n'emp\u00eache la rel\u00e9gation de son \u00e9quipe, en terminant \u00e0 la 18e place du classement.\r\n\r\nLe 28 juillet 2014, il quitte d\u00e9finitivement l'Olympique de Marseille et s'engage avec le FC Lorient pour quatre saisons. Initialement, il devait porter le n\u00b011, mais suite au d\u00e9part de Vincent Aboubakar \u00e0 Porto, il r\u00e9cup\u00e8re le n\u00b09 port\u00e9 l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re par ce dernier.\r\n\r\nJordan Ayew commence sa carri\u00e8re internationale directement en \u00e9quipe premi\u00e8re du Ghana le 5 septembre 2010 contre le Swaziland (3-0) pour les qualifications de la CAN 2012. Il remplace son fr\u00e8re Andr\u00e9 en seconde p\u00e9riode.\r\n\r\nLe 23 octobre 2010, il participe \u00e0 son premier match avec l'\u00e9quipe du Ghana des moins de 20 ans contre le B\u00e9nin (4-1), il marque \u00e9galement un but lors de cette rencontre du deuxi\u00e8me tour qualificatif de la Coupe d'Afrique des nations junior 2011.\r\n\r\nLe 1er juin 2012, Ayew inscrit ses deux premiers buts en s\u00e9lection lors du match comptant pour les \u00e9liminatoires de la Coupe du monde 2014 face au Lesotho (7-0). Le 10 juin 2014 Jordan Ayew inscrit son premier tripl\u00e9 en s\u00e9lection lors d'un match amical contre la Cor\u00e9e du Sud.\r\n",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Ki Sung-yueng (Korean: \uae30\uc131\uc6a9, Korean pronunciation: ; born 24 January 1989) is a South Korean professional footballer who currently plays as a central midfielder for Premier League club Swansea City, and serves as captain of the South Korean national team.\r\n\r\nKi is known for his vision, technique, long-range passing and shooting, along with his good set-pieces.\r\n\r\nHe has been a full international for South Korea since 2007, gaining over 70 caps. Ki was selected in their squads for two World Cups and the 2011 and 2015 AFC Asian Cups, finishing as runner-up in the latter tournament. He has also played at two Olympic Games with his country, winning bronze in 2012.\r\n\r\nOn 20 May 2015, Ki was voted as Swansea City Player of the Year as he netted 8 goals in 33 appearances.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Ki went to Brisbane, Australia to study at John Paul College under the BSP (Brain Soccer Program) overseen by Jeff Hopkins. His father saw the move as an opportunity for Ki to play football and learn English at the same time. Ki played his youth football for the school team and was part of the team that won the 2004 Bill Turner Cup, the national inter-school U-15 soccer competition. Ki received offers in 2005 from Korean club FC Seoul and also A-League club Brisbane Roar (then Queensland Roar), but decided to move back to South Korea to continue his career. After moving back to Korea, Ki attended Kumho high school and then enrolled in Kyonggi University. Since then, Ki has been a fluent English speaker. He went by his English name David in Australia. Ki has also expressed a desire to one day return to Australia to finish his career and raise his family.\r\n\r\nKi confirmed in March 2013 that he was dating actress Han Hye-jin, and announced their engagement in May 2013. The couple filed their marriage registration on June 25, 2013, and wed on July 1 at the Intercontinental Hotel Seoul. Both are devout Christians. They have a daughter, born on September 13, 2015.\r\n\r\nOn 19 November 2007, Ki wrote \"If you are frustrated, why don't you go out and play?\" on his Cyworld page in response to the criticism by Korean fans after the South Korea U-23 team's goalless draw against Uzbekistan.Ki deleted his statement after being heavily condemned for his careless behaviour.\r\n\r\nOn 25 January 2011, during the 2011 AFC Asian Cup semi-final match between Japan and South Korea, Ki scored the opening goal through a penalty kick. Ki created a controversy by celebrating his goal by making a monkey face and scratching his cheek in front of a pitch-side camera in an allegedly racist slur at Japanese people. Ki initially defended his goal celebration through a Twitter post claiming that he was annoyed at having seen a Rising Sun Flag in the stadium. Ki then claimed that the celebration was a reference to alleged racist abuse he had received during Scottish Premier League games from opposition fans, but the chief executive of Show Racism the Red Card expressed scepticism about this. Asian Cup tournament director Tokuaki Suzuki said that no action will be taken on part of the AFC and that FIFA has not contacted the AFC regarding the matter.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2013, it was widely reported that Ki had previously insulted then South Korea national team manager Choi Kang-hee on his Facebook page before and after the match against Kuwait in February 2012. Ki wrote, \"Now everyone should have realised the value of the players who play overseas.  should have left us alone, otherwise,  will be hurt.\" Ki later apologised for his \"mischievous and inappropriate remarks\" and his father visited the KFA to apologise as well.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Bo Kristoffer Nordfeldt (born 23 June 1989) is a Swedish footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Welsh club Swansea City.\r\n\r\nNordfeldt began his career in Brommapojkarna, famous for its academy. He was promoted to the first team for the season of 2006, when the team was playing in Superettan. Nordfeldt did not play any league games that year, or the following year when the team was playing for the first time in Allsvenskan.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Brommapojkarna were back in Superettan and both goalkeepers, Mattias Asper and Kristoffer Bj\u00f6rklund, had left the club. Nordfeldt started his first year as a senior and when the season ended, the club had seen a promotion back to the Allsvenskan. He had started 29 out of 30 league games, conceding 27 goals, and achieving 12 clean sheets. Nordfeldt signed a new contract in the beginning of 2009, keeping him at the club until 2012. As newcomers for the season of 2009, the club was seen as favourites for relegation, but finished a comfortable 12th. He played 21 league games, conceding 31 goals and keeping 6 clean sheets.\r\n\r\nOn 2 August 2010, there were several scouts spotted at Grimsta to watch the game between Brommapojkarna and the league leaders Helsingborg. The clubs thought to be interested in Nordfeldt were Ajax, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Hannover, Heerenveen and Sampdoria.\r\n\r\nOn 6 March 2012, Nordfeldt signed a three-and-a-half-year-deal at Dutch top flight club SC Heerenveen. He featured over 100 times for the Dutch side, helping them reach the Eredivisie play-offs for Europa League qualification in each of his three seasons at the club.\r\n\r\nOn 23 June 2015, Nordfeldt signed for Premier League side Swansea City on a three-year-deal for an undisclosed fee. He was signed to compete with \u0141ukasz Fabia\u0144ski for the starting position, following the departures of goalkeepers Gerhard Tremmel and David Cornell earlier in that transfer window. Nordfeldt made his Swansea City debut on Tuesday 25th of August in the Capital One Cup match vs York City where Nordfelt played the full 90 minutes and Swansea went on to win 3-0 and Nordfelt also grabbing his first clean sheet for the club. Nordfeldt made his Premier League debut in the last game of the season against Manchester City.\r\n\r\nBetween 2008 and 2010, Nordfeldt played 16 games for the Swedish U21-team. In the race for the 2011 U21 European Championships, Sweden played 8 games in their qualification group and 2 in the play-offs, all with Nordfeldt in the starting lineup, with a goal difference of 17 \u2013 10.\r\n\r\nNordfeldt made his debut for Sweden on 22 January 2011 in a friendly game against South Africa Development team.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Leroy Johan Fer (born 5 January 1990) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder for Swansea City and the Netherlands national football team.\r\n\r\nFer has various nicknames. In his youth he got nicknamed De Uitsmijter (The Bouncer) by Feyenoord youth coach Jean-Paul van Gastel for his strong physical appearance. Other nicknames are Lerra and Ferovic. Cor Pot, coach of the Netherlands U21, compared Fer with Patrick Vieira. According to Pot both players show many similarities, on and off the field.\r\n\r\nFer was born and raised in Zoetermeer, South Holland, the Netherlands. He is the first child of parents of Cura\u00e7aoan descent. Fer's grandfather was a football player on Cura\u00e7ao, while his father, Lesley Fer, was a baseball player. Fer has one younger brother named Leegreg. who played for the Feyenoord-U17 team.\r\n\r\nFer was raised Catholic: \"In Zoetermeer we went to church every day. God gave me my football talent. I thank Him for that every day.\" On his right lower arm he has a tattoo of the Christian cross with the text \"In God I trust\".\r\n\r\nOn 1 February 2016, Fer joined Premier League side Swansea City on loan for the remainder of the season after failing to make an impact under Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. He made his move to South Wales permanent on 5 July 2016.\r\n\r\nDespite playing for the Netherlands on various youth levels, Fer was in doubt which country to represent, as he was eligible to play for both the Netherlands and Netherlands Antilles. In October 2008, Fer claimed he hadn't made a decision yet: \"Personally I want to mean something for my island. That's why I'm still in doubt. My brain says it's better to choose for the Netherlands. Then you're assured of a big tournament every two years. But my heart is thinking of Cura\u00e7ao. It would be fantastic to play a World Cup with Netherlands Antilles, it would give the islands an enormous boost. My roots are stronger than my urge to a career, I'm striving for a higher cause. I don't know yet, but my feelings to play for Netherlands Antilles are very strong.\" However, on 26 August 2009, Fer announced he made the final decision and chose to represent the Netherlands on international level. He was selected for the Netherlands 23 man squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He scored his first World Cup goal in the group match against Chile on 23 June 2014, after coming on the field as a substitute.",

He made his debut for the Denmark national team in March 2010, and was the youngest player of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. He is affectionly nicknamed The Prince of Denmark.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Eriksen was named Danish Football Player of the Year, Dutch Football Talent of the Year, Ajax Talent of the Year (Marco van Basten Award), and made the UEFA Euro U-21 Team of the Tournament. He won the Eredivisie with Ajax in 2010\u201311, 2011\u201312, and in 2012\u201313 before signing with Tottenham Hotspur in August 2013. Eriksen won Tottenham Hotspur 'Player of the Year' award for the 2013\u201314 season. In 2015, Eriksen won the Danish Football Player of the Year for the second year in a row.\r\n\r\nEriksen started playing football in his hometown Middelfart before his third birthday. In 2005 he switched to Odense Boldklub, who competed in the Danish youth championships. His team lost the semi-final against Br\u00f8ndby IF, but afterwards he was named \"Best Technical Player\" of the tournament. The following year OB won the tournament, when Eriksen scored the only goal in the final. After some good performances for OB's U-16 team and later on U-19 team and the Danish U-17 team, major European football clubs including Chelsea and Barcelona began to take notice.The player had trials with Barcelona, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Milan, but finally decided to move to Ajax, stating \"My first step should not be too big. I knew that playing in the Netherlands would be very good for my development. Then Ajax arrived and that was a fantastic option\".",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Bamidele Jermaine \"Dele\" Alli (born 11 April 1996) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur and the England national team.\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in Milton Keynes, he joined the youth system at Milton Keynes Dons aged 11 and broke into the first team five years later, during the 2012\u201313 season. Over the next two-and-a-half years he made 88 official appearances for the team, scoring 24 goals. He signed for Tottenham Hotspur in February 2015 for an initial fee of \u00a35 million, being loaned back to the Dons for the remainder of the season. In his first full campaign at White Hart Lane, Alli was voted the PFA Young Player of the Year. He was ranked 8th in Gazzetta dello Sport best 50 footballers under-20.\r\n\r\nAlli played for the England U17, U18 and U19 teams. He made his senior debut in 2015 and was selected for UEFA Euro 2016.\r\n\r\nAlli was born and raised in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, to a Yoruba Nigerian father Kenny and English mother Denise. He went to Stantonbury Campus and The Radcliffe School in Wolverton. He joined the youth system at Milton Keynes Dons when he was 11 years old. He made his debut for the first team as a sixteen-year-old on 2 November 2012, coming on as a 64th-minute substitute for Jay O'Shea in a 0\u20130 draw with Southern Football League club Cambridge City in the FA Cup first round at Milton Road. His first touch in professional football was a back-heeled pass. His first goal came in the replay against Cambridge eleven days later, where he scored in a 6\u20131 win at Stadium mk on his first start. He made his league debut in the 2\u20133 defeat to Coventry City at home on 29 December, where he played 71 minutes before being replaced by Zeli Ismail. His only other league appearance in the 2012\u201313 Football League One season, came as a second-half substitute for Patrick Bamford in the last game of the season, a 2\u20130 win over Stevenage at Broadhall Way.\r\n\r\nAlli has made several appearances at U17 and U18 levels for England. On 27 August 2014, Alli was called up to the England U19 squad following an impressive start to the campaign. He made his debut for England U19 in the 1\u20131 draw against Germany U19. In the game, Alli assisted the opening goal feeding a through ball to Bradley Fewster who gave England a 1\u20130 lead.\r\n\r\nIn February 2015, it was reported that John Fashanu would try to convince Alli to play for Nigeria. However, on 1 October of that year, he was included in Roy Hodgson's England squad for the final UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying matches against Estonia and Lithuania. He made his debut against the former on 9 October, coming on as a late substitute for Ross Barkley in a 2\u20130 win.\r\n\r\nOn 17 November 2015, Alli made his first start for the England senior team, scoring the opening goal from a long range shot to beat Spurs teammate, goalkeeper Hugo Lloris in a 2\u20130 win against France at Wembley Stadium. He was again named in the starting line-up for England's friendly match against world champions Germany on 26 March 2016. Alli was named man of the match by the BBC as England recovered from 0\u20132 down to win 3\u20132 at the Berlin Olympiastadion.\r\n\r\nAlli was a Liverpool fan growing up, and Steven Gerrard, Jason Puncheon and Yaya Toure were his childhood idols.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "\u00c9rik Manuel Lamela (born 4 March 1992) is an Argentine footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder or winger for Tottenham Hotspur and the Argentina national team. He is known for his exceptional dribbling ability and pace and is nicknamed Coco.\r\nAfter joining River Plate as a seven-year-old Barcelona reportedly offered Lamela and his family \u00a3100,000 a year, as well as a house and employment for his parents, to move to Barcelona, in a similar deal to the one that saw Lionel Messi move to Spain as a youngster. In 2004, a Trans World Sport film crew travelled to Argentina to interview a 12-year-old Lamela who was already making headlines after scoring 120 goals for River Plate's youth side the previous season. In the video, Lamela declares his wish to follow in the footsteps of Diego Maradona and win a World Cup for Argentina.\r\nLamela made his first team debut for Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate on 14 June 2009 in a game against Tigre for the 2009 Clausura tournament. He entered the field on the 80th minute, substituting Robert Flores. Lamela scored his first goal for River on 5 December 2010 in a match against Col\u00f3n for the Apertura tournament. He scored his second goal against Lan\u00fas in the final fixture of that Apertura, helping River win the match 4\u20131.\r\n\r\nThe midfielder was a regular starter for River during the 2010\u201311 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n season, playing 34 games and scoring four goals. He helped his team to finish in an overall sixth place that would have qualified them for the 2011 Copa Sudamericana. Due to the relegation format of the Argentine Primera that accounts a team's last three seasons, however, River was relegated after losing a playoff with Belgrano.\r\n\r\nOn 6 August 2011, Lamela joined Italian Serie A club Roma for a fee \u20ac12 million, plus \u20ac2 million in bonuses, which was activated after his 20th club appearance. Roma also paid an additional \u20ac3.2 million to Orel B.V. \u2014 plus 10% added value if the player is later sold above \u20ac12 million \u2014 and \u20ac3.06 million in the form of taxes to the Government of Argentina. Lamela signed a 5-year contract worth \u20ac1.8 million in gross in the first season, but would gradually increase by \u20ac350,000 on 1 July 2012 (to \u20ac2.15M), 2014 (\u20ac2.5M) and 2015 (\u20ac2.85M). On 23 October 2011, he scored his first goal in Serie A against Palermo. Later, he scored goals against Lecce, Novara, and Cesena. Lamela ended his first season at the Stadio Olimpico with six goals in 31 games in all competitions.\r\n\r\nLamela began the 2012\u201313 season well, his first goal of the season coming against Bologna on 16 September 2012. Lamela hit a superb patch of form in October and early November, scoring seven goals in six games, including a brace against Udinese in a 3\u20132 home defeat and goals against Atalanta, Genoa, Parma, and Palermo. He also scored a goal in the Derby della Capitale against Lazio. After almost a month out with an ankle ligament injury, he returned to the field and scored a brace against Milan in a 4\u20132 victory on 22 December.\r\n\r\nLamela went on to score 15 times in 33 games, putting him joint-fifth in Serie A and second to striker Pablo Osvaldo (16 goals) at Roma. Lamela's and Roma's season, however, ended in heartache with defeat to Rome rivals Lazio in the Coppa Italia final, coupled with finishing sixth in Serie A, meaning that Roma would not play European football for the second consecutive season.\r\n\r\nOn 30 August 2013, Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur completed the transfer of Lamela from Roma for a deal worth an initial \u00a325.8 million, plus up to \u00a34.2 million in bonus payments. The fee for Lamela made him the most expensive player in the club's history, breaking the two previous records that had been set earlier in the transfer window, first for Paulinho and then Roberto Soldado.",

In June 2012, Wimmer moved from Austrian side LASK Linz to German club 1. FC K\u00f6ln for a \u20ac250,000 transfer fee. On 5 August 2012, he made his debut in a 1\u20130 loss to Eintracht Braunschweig. He went on to become a regular in K\u00f6ln's defence. On 29 November 2013, Wimmer scored his first goal in a 3\u20130 win over FC St. Pauli.\r\n\r\nIn the 2013\u201314 season, Wimmer helped the club set a 2. Bundesliga record only conceding 20 goals as they earned promotion to the Bundesliga. Wimmer continued his good performances in Germany's top division to help K\u00f6ln stay in the Bundesliga, managing to avoid defeat against every team, save for Bayern Munich and SC Freiburg, at least once. The team played a Bundesliga record nine 0\u20130 draws, equalling Bayern Munich's 1966 Bundesliga record of not conceding a goal in 13 matches. In the 2014\u201315 season, Wimmer started 32 matches and was named the seventh-best defender in the league by football magazine Kicker.\r\n\r\nOn 29 May 2015, Wimmer joined English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur on a five-year contract for a reported \u00a34.3 million transfer fee. On 30 July, he made his Tottenham debut against the MLS All-Stars in a 2\u20131 defeat in Denver, Colorado. Wimmer replaced captain Jan Vertonghen after 45 minutes and made his debut alongside fellow new signings Dele Alli, Kieran Trippier and Toby Alderweireld. He wore the number 27 for the club.\r\n\r\nOn 4 August 2015, Wimmer made his first start for the club in a 2\u20130 defeat to Real Madrid in the Audi Cup, played in Munich. He was replaced by Jan Vertonghen after 46 minutes. Wimmer made his first league appearance of the 2015\u201316 Premier League season on 23 January 2016 when he came on as a substitute in a 3\u20131 win over Crystal Palace.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Kieran John Trippier (born 19 September 1990) is an English footballer who plays as a right back for Tottenham Hotspur.\r\n\r\nTrippier started his career in the youth system at Manchester City but failed to make the breakthrough to the first team and didn't make a professional appearance. In February 2010, he joined Football League Championship side Barnsley on a one-month loan. He re-joined the club in August 2010 for a six-month loan which was later extended until the end of the season. In July 2011, he signed for Championship side Burnley on a season-long loan which was made permanent in January 2012 for an undisclosed fee, signing a three-and-a-half year contract. He was named in the Championship PFA Team of the Year for two consecutive seasons in 2012\u201313 and 2013\u201314. In 2014 he secured promotion with Burnley to the Premier League as the side finished runners-up in the Championship. He has also represented England at all levels from under-18 to under-21, featuring in the 2009 UEFA European Under-19 Championship and 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup.\r\n\r\nBorn in Bury, Trippier joined Manchester City's academy at the age of nine, where he progressed through the ranks at the club, signing his first professional contract in 2007. In the 2007\u201308 season he became a regular in the reserve side and was also captain of the side that won the FA Youth Cup. In August 2009, he featured in the prestige friendly against FC Barcelona at the Camp Nou. He joined the first-team for the pre-season tour of the United States in the summer of 2010.\r\n\r\nTrippier was first called up by England at under-18 level in November 2007 for an international friendly against Ghana at the Priestfield Stadium, Gillingham. He made his debut in the 2\u20130 victory, coming on as a late substitute for Seth Nana Twumasi. He then progressed to the under-19 squad in November 2008 for the 2009 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualification match against Albania, making his debut in the 3\u20130 win in Coleraine, Northern Ireland. He was a mainstay in the team as the squad qualified for the 2009 UEFA European Under-19 Championship finals in Ukraine, and was named in the squad for the finals of the tournament. He featured heavily in the tournament as England reached the final but were beaten 2\u20130 by the hosts Ukraine. After reaching the final, England qualified for the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Egypt a month later and Trippier was named in the twenty-one man squad. He featured in all three games as England were eliminated finishing bottom of the group with defeats to Uruguay and Ghana, and the 1\u20131 draw with Uzbekistan. In October 2010, he received his first call-up to the under-21 squad for the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship play-off against Romania, however he failed to feature. He made his debut a month later in the international friendly with Germany, a 2\u20130 defeat. His final appearance for the under-21's came in an international friendly against Italy in February 2011 at the Stadio Carlo Castellani in Empoli. He came on as a second-half substitute for Josh McEachran in a 1\u20130 defeat.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Son Heung-min (Hangul: \uc190\ud765\ubbfc ; born 8 July 1992) is a South Korean footballer who plays for English club Tottenham Hotspur and the South Korea national team.\r\n\r\nSon finished his development at Hamburger SV, where he made his debut in the German Bundesliga in 2010. In 2013, he moved to Bayer Leverkusen for a club record \u20ac10 million, and played for the club in the UEFA Europa League and UEFA Champions League. Two years later, he signed for Tottenham Hotspur for \u00a322 million, becoming the most expensive Asian player in history.\r\n\r\nA full international since 2010, Son has represented South Korea at the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the AFC Asian Cup in 2011 and 2015, helping them finish as runners-up in the latter.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Son dropped out of Dongbuk High School(formerly FC Seoul U-18 Team) and joined Hamburg's youth academy at the age of 16. He eventually scored a goal in six matches during the 2009\u201310 season for Hamburger SV II. He was impressive in the 2010\u201311 preseason, leading the team with nine goals and signed his first professional contract on his 18th birthday. After scoring against Chelsea in August, he was injured for two months due to a foot injury. He came back on 30 October 2010 scoring his first league goal against 1. FC K\u00f6ln in the 24th minute. The goal made Son the youngest HSV player to have scored a goal in Bundesliga at 18 years, thus breaking the record held by Manfred Kaltz.\r\n\r\nSon signed a new deal with Hamburg, which would keep him at the club until 2014. It was stated that Son had what it takes to become the next Cha Bum-Kun, a legendary Bundesliga forward and fellow South Korean. He scored three goals in 14 matches in all competition during the 2010\u201311 season.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2011\u201312 pre-season, Son went goalless for nine games. After missing the opening game due to a fever, Son scored two goals within three games. Unfortunately, mirroring last season, Son picked up an ankle injury in the 4\u20133 loss to 1. FC K\u00f6ln on 27 August and was initially projected to be out of action for four to six weeks. Fortunately, Son's recovery was quicker than expected, and he returned to action only three weeks later as a substitute in the 1\u20130 loss against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach on 17 September. Over the course of the 2011\u201312 season, Son made 30 appearances for Hamburg and scored 5 goals, including crucial goals against Hannover and Nurnberg at the end of the season to help ensure that Hamburg remained in the Bundesliga.\r\n\r\nFollowing Hamburger SV's 2012\u201313 off-season moves, which saw the transfers of the team's strikers Mladen Petri\u0107 and Paolo Guerrero to Fulham and Corinthians respectively, manager Thorsten Fink chose to place Son in a starting role for the team. The 2012\u201313 season was a breakthrough season for Son as he scored two goals in the away fixture against Borussia Dortmund on 9 February 2013, helping his side to a 4\u20131 victory. Son was chosen Mann des Tages (Man of the Match) by Kicker. His frequent goals against Dortmund earned him the nickname \"Bee-farmer\", referring to the opponents' mascot. On 14 April, Son netted two goals in a 2\u20131 win against Mainz. He finished the season with 12 goals, becoming the fourth Asian footballer to achieve double-digits in goals in the 'Big 3' European football leagues. He finished the 2012\u201313 season with 12 goals in 34 matches in all competitions.\r\n\r\nOn 24 December 2010, Son was named in South Korea's squad for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, making his debut for the national team in a pre-tournament friendly against Syria on 30 December. At the tournament finals, Son scored his first international goal during a 4\u2013 1 group stage defeat of India.\r\n\r\nOn 7 October 2011, after initially missing the first two games of South Korea's 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign on 2 and 6 September 2011 due to an ankle injury, Son played in a friendly against Poland, and was again featured in the 11 October World Cup qualifier against the United Arab Emirates. His selection for national team play was a point of concern for Son's father, however, who caused a stir by asking the Korea Football Association not to select his son for the national team in the immediate future so he can rest and mature more as a player. Cho Kwang-Rae (who was the South Korea coach at the time) responded by saying that he would continue to call up Son when needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSon being interviewed after a friendly against Haiti in September 2013\r\nSon turned down the opportunity to participate in the 2012 London Olympics, opting to concentrate on his club career at Hamburg. Son was quoted as saying, \"In Korea, an Olympic appearance has a special meaning, but I want to speed up for Hamburg. What matters is to pour all my time into team training.\" Son did, however, play for the national team in the autumn of 2012 for two 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Lebanon and Iran, and has become a regular call-up in friendlies and World Cup qualifying matches in 2013. In the World Cup qualifier against Qatar on 23 March 2013, Son came on as a substitute in the 81st minute and scored the winning goal in the 96th minute.\r\n\r\nIn June 2014, Son was named in South Korea's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. On 22 June, he scored in a 4\u20132 defeat to Algeria in the team's second group match. Following the exit, Son was one of the few players who were praised for their performances at the World Cup.\r\n\r\nThe Korea Football Association requested Bayer Leverkusen to allow Son to play in the 2014 Asian Games, as winning the gold medal at the tournament would grant Son exemption from military service. Despite Son affirming his interest and the KFA's efforts, Leverkusen refused to release him, as Son's absence would mean the team would lose him for at least six games.\r\n\r\nSon was selected for South Korea for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup in Australia. At the quarter-final stage, he scored both of the team's goals in the 2\u20130 extra time defeat of Uzbekistan. In the final against the hosts, he equalised in added time, but his team lost 2\u20131 after extra time. He was chosen as one of three forwards in the Team of the Tournament.\r\n\r\nOn 3 September 2015 at the Hwaseong Stadium, Son scored a hat-trick in an 8\u20130 home win over Laos in the second round of qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Tobias Albertine Maurits \"Toby\" Alderweireld (Dutch pronunciation: ; born 2 March 1989) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays for Tottenham Hotspur and the Belgium national team. Mainly a central defender, he can also play as a right back.\r\n\r\nAlderweireld began his professional career at Dutch club Ajax, where he won honours including three consecutive Eredivisie titles. In 2013 he moved to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, where he won La Liga and reached the UEFA Champions League final in his first season.\r\n\r\nA full international since 2009, he has earned over 50 caps for Belgium and represented the country at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\r\n\r\nBorn in Antwerp, Alderweireld moved to Ajax's youth academy in August 2004 from Germinal Beerschot. On 22 February 2007, he signed his first professional contract tying him to the club until 30 June 2010. He was promoted to the first team for the 2008\u201309 season but only made his first team debut on 18 January, in the 4\u20132 victory over NEC Nijmegen. On 26 February, he made his European debut during a 1\u20131 draw against Fiorentina in the UEFA Cup. Although he only made several appearances for the remainder of the season, he was awarded a new long-term contract extension until 2014.\r\n\r\nDuring the early stages of the 2009\u201310 season, Alderweireld established himself in the first team and starting eleven. He became first choice centre-back along with fellow Belgian Jan Vertonghen after the departure of former captain Thomas Vermaelen to Arsenal. New coach Martin Jol praised the two defenders and kept faith in the duo after a string of good performances. During the 4 September win against Heracles that ended 3\u20130, he scored his first league goal for the club when he opened the scoring with a header from Luis Su\u00e1rez's corner. On 27 January, he scored a late equaliser in extra time during the KNVB Cup quarter final against NEC Nijmegen and Siem de Jong's late goal five minutes before the final whistle sealed a 3\u20132 win for Ajax. At the end of the 2009\u201310 season, Alderweireld was named \"Ajax Talent of the Year\". He assured himself of a place in the Eredivisie giants' history books on 3 November 2011, heading in Ajax's 100th UEFA Champions League goal in the 2\u20131 Group G defeat by Auxerre. In the 2010\u201311 season, he scored a stunning 25-yard strike at the San Siro against Champions League group rivals AC Milan in a 2\u20130 away win. He followed this spectacular goal with an even more impressive 32-yard strike against Feyenoord in a 2\u20130 home win.\r\n\r\nOn 8 July 2015, Alderweireld joined Tottenham Hotspur on a five-year contract which runs until the summer of 2020 at White Hart Lane despite Southampton threatening legal action over the transfer. The transfer fee is estimated to be \u00a311.5 million. He was reunited with former Ajax teammates Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen, who previously joined the north London side from Ajax.\r\n\r\nOn 30 July, Alderweireld made his club debut in the 2015 MLS All-Star Game in Denver, Colorado. During a 2\u20131 defeat, Alderweireld started the game and was replaced by Federico Fazio after 62 minutes.\r\n\r\nOn 26 September, Alderweireld scored his first goal for Tottenham in a 4\u20131 win over Manchester City at White Hart Lane. His second goal for the club came in another 4\u20131 victory over London rivals West Ham United on 22 November.\r\n\r\nOn 5 March 2016, in the 183rd North London Derby, Alderweireld scored for Tottenham in a 2\u20132 draw against Arsenal. A month later, he was Spurs' second scorer in a 3\u20130 defeat of Manchester United.\r\n\r\nDuring his first season at Tottenham, Alderweireld has been recognised by commentators as one of the best defenders in the Premier League, forming impressive central defensive partnerships with national team colleague Jan Vertonghen, and later the Austrian Kevin Wimmer. This form has helped Tottenham to achieve the best defensive record in the Premier League, with only 25 goals conceded from 34 games.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "\u00c9tienne Capoue (born 11 July 1988) is a French professional footballer who plays for English club Tottenham Hotspur. He can play as either a defensive midfielder or defender. Capoue was a French youth international having earned caps at under-18, under-19, and under-21 level. Capoue served as captain for a portion of his stint with the latter team. He is the younger brother of Boulogne player Aur\u00e9lien Capoue.\r\nCapoue was born in the commune of Niort in Deux-S\u00e8vres and began his career playing for hometown club Chamois Niortais. In 2002, he departed the club and joined FC Chauray, a local club in Poitou-Charentes. Capoue stayed at the club for two years before joining Angers SCO in Pays de la Loire. While playing in a youth league match against Toulouse, Capoue drew the attention of the club's scouts who offered the player a one-week trial. Prior to agreeing to the internship, he was also approached by Lille, Auxerre, and Bordeaux. Capoue chose Toulouse because of the club's training facilities and the good weather.\r\nCapoue began his club career with Toulouse in 2006 playing on the club's under-18 team. During the early portion of the 2007\u201308 season, he played on the club's Championnat de France amateur team in the fourth division making eight appearances. Midway through the season, Capoue was called up to the senior team by manager Alain Casanova. On 8 December 2007, he made his professional debut appearing as a substitute in a 1\u20130 victory over Lille. The following week, Capoue made his first professional start against Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes. Toulouse won the match 2\u20131 with Capoue playing 71 minutes.\r\nOn 7 February 2008, Capoue, along with teammate Cheikh M'Bengue, signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal until 2011. For the 2008\u201309 season, Casanova paired the young defensive midfielder with former youth teammate Moussa Sissoko and new signing \u00c9tienne Didot, who arrived from Rennes. The trio performed well in the midfield with Capoue flourishing making 36 total appearances. On 18 October 2008, Capoue scored his first professional goal against Bordeaux in a 2\u20131 defeat. During the season, he also received 14 yellow cards in all competitions, second to only Siaka Ti\u00e9n\u00e9 of Valenciennes in the league. For his efforts, he was nominated for the Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year award and awarded a contract extension until 2013 by his club.\r\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, Capoue appeared regularly in the first team and drew interest from Italian club Lazio and Premier League clubs Liverpool and Arsenal. On 26 November 2009, Toulouse responded to the interest by reaching an agreement with Capoue on a one-year contract extension until 2014. Capoue appeared in 41 total matches for the season collecting 17 total yellow cards, 13 of which came in Ligue 1, leading all players.\r\nIn July 2013, Toulouse accepted a reported \u00a39.5 million bid from Premier League side Cardiff City. However, personal terms were not agreed and the deal was not finalised. On 15 August 2013, he completed an \u20ac11m (\u00a39.3m) transfer to Tottenham Hotspur.\r\nOn 15 August 2013, Tottenham Hotspur officially announced Capoue via their website and Twitter page. The day before the announcement of Capoue, Tottenham and France's first choice goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris told French paper L'Equipe that joining Tottenham is a big step in Capoue's career. He stated his delight to see the fellow countrymen join Tottenham. Capoue made his debut for Spurs on 18 August 2013, replacing Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 in a 1\u20130 win away to Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.",

Born in Chigorod\u00f3, Antioquia, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga made his professional debut with Colombian giant Atl\u00e9tico Nacional. With Nacional, he gained three titles while being at the club for seven seasons. In total, he made 129 league appearances and scored 9 goals.\r\nZ\u00fa\u00f1iga played for Colombia in the 2005 World Youth Cup before progressing to the senior national team in 2005. He was regarded as being similar to other famous adventurous full-backs such as Cafu and Roberto Carlos by the Italian press during the under-20 World Youth Cup, because of his attacking nature.\r\n\r\nZ\u00fa\u00f1iga started most of Colombia 2014 World Cup qualifiers, only missing two games: against Venezuela after being given permission to leave the team for the birth of his son, and against Peru due to injury.\r\n\r\nHe was called up for the 2014 World Cup and appeared in four of the five matches that Colombia played in the tournament. On 4 July 2014, while Colombia's quarter-final match against hosts Brazil was nearing its end, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga landed his right knee in Neymar's lower back while challenging for the ball. Neymar was stretchered off and further examinations showed that Neymar suffered a fractured third lumbar vertebra, ruling him out of the rest of the World Cup. After the match, which Colombia lost 2-1, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga insisted that he had not meant to injure Neymar. Neymar's teammate Thiago Silva defended Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, stating that he is not the type of player who would purposely cause an injury to any player. Conversely, Brazilian legend Ronaldo said that he believes the very violent challenge was a foul with the intention to cause harm. The day after the match, it was revealed that Z\u00fa\u00f1iga had sent a letter of apology to Neymar, saying that he was \"deeply sorry and sad\" for unintentionally causing the injury. Neymar later accepted the apology. Though Zu\u00f1iga publicly apologized to Neymar, his Instagram and Twitter accounts were flooded with racial insults and death threats to him and his family by some Brazilian fans.\r\n\r\nDespite disputed sentiment and false slander, a year later at Copa America 2015 Juan Camilo Z\u00fa\u00f1iga would participate against Brazil in the second group match which an on-pitch brawl broke out following Colombia's 1\u20130 win over Brazil; Brazilian captain at the time Neymar deliberately kicked the ball at opponent Pablo Armero and attempted to headbutt Colombian matchwinner Jeison Murillo, earning a red card. As a result, Colombian forward Carlos Bacca retaliated by pushing Neymar over, and was himself sent off. CONMEBOL fined Neymar $10,000 and suspended him for four matches, ruling him out for the remainder of the tournament, while Bacca was suspended for two matches. Although Juan Camilo Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was nowhere involved in the incident it draw an exonerating parallel based on the professionalism between both athletes.",

Between 2007 and 2009 he played for Manchester United's reserve team, and occasionally in first team friendly matches. Cleverley was loaned to League One side Leicester City at the start of 2009, for whom he made his first Football League appearances, helping the team secure the League One title and promotion to the Championship. He spent the 2009\u201310 season on loan with Watford in the Championship, where he scored 11 goals in 33 league games and was voted as their Player of the Season. On 31 August 2010, he joined Wigan Athletic on a season-long loan, where he scored four goals in 25 appearances and helped them to avoid relegation on the final day of the season. He returned to Manchester United for the start of the 2011\u201312 season and made his first competitive appearance in the Community Shield victory against Manchester City.\r\n\r\nCleverley played for Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics, and later that year made his debut for the senior England team.\r\n\r\nCleverley was born in Basingstoke, Hampshire, but grew up in Bradford, West Yorkshire. He went to Hanson school. He was part of Bradford City's youth set up and the next summer he joined Manchester United as an 11-year-old trainee in July 2000. During the 2005\u201306 season, he made nine appearances for the under-18 side. He also received a taste of reserve team football when he was named on the bench for the team's 4\u20131 away win over Everton on 21 February 2006. His first appearance for the reserves came in a 0\u20130 away draw to Bolton Wanderers almost a year later, on 15 February 2007, by which time he had become a regular in the under-18 team. However, just over a month later, he suffered a long-term injury and was ruled out for seven months.\r\n\r\nHe returned to action in October 2007, playing for the reserves in a 1\u20131 home draw with Liverpool. The 2007\u201308 season marked Cleverley's emergence as a regular in the Manchester United reserve team, making 21 appearances as the team went on to win both the Manchester Senior Cup and the Lancashire Senior Cup, in which he scored in the final against Liverpool. He also scored his first goals in a Manchester United shirt on 23 January 2008, when he scored both of United's goals in a 2\u20130 away win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier Reserve League. His consistent performances for the reserves earned him the captaincy of the team in the absence of regular captain Sam Hewson, as well as a nomination for the Denzil Haroun Reserve Player of the Year award \u2013 he lost out to Richard Eckersley.\r\n\r\nIn recognition of his performances for the reserves, on 24 July 2008, Cleverley was called up to the Manchester United first team for the remainder of their tour of South Africa and the match against Portsmouth in Nigeria. He made his first team debut against Kaizer Chiefs in the final of the 2008 Vodacom Challenge, coming on in place of Rodrigo Possebon at half-time, before he scored the third of United's four goals just after the hour mark.\r\n\r\nHe returned to regular reserve team duty for the 2008\u201309 season, but was given a first team squad number \u2013 35 \u2013 when the first team squad list was announced on 15 August 2008, and was named on the bench for United's League Cup matches against Middlesbrough and Queens Park Rangers.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Troy Matthew Deeney (born 29 June 1988) is an English professional footballer who plays for and captains Premier League club Watford. He plays primarily as a striker . Deeney started his professional career at Walsall. He transferred to Football League Championship side Watford in 2010 and captained the side to promotion to the Premier League in the 2014\u201315 season.\r\n\r\nDeeney was born in Birmingham, West Midlands, and grew up in Chelmsley Wood. He was one of three children born to his parents, who split up when he was 11. He was expelled from school when he was 14, before returning at the age of 15. He left at 16 without any GCSEs and began training as a bricklayer, earning \u00a3120 a week.\r\n\r\nOn 25 June 2012, Deeney was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment for kicking a man in the head during a brawl. He was released after serving almost three months of the sentence, after showing his remorse, and since he was a first time offender. Since his release from prison in 2012, he has earned GCSEs in English, science and maths.\r\n\r\nDeeney is married and has a son, Myles, and a daughter, Amelia. His brother, Ellis, is a semi-professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder. Ellis started his career at Aston Villa, where he was captain of their academy side before being released. Having played for Kettering Town, Hinckley United and Worcester City he now plays for Tamworth. He is a personal trainer, and Deeney helped fund his training in the profession.\r\n\r\nDeeney was invited by the Aston Villa academy to take part a four-day summer trial at the age of 15 with a view to earning a youth contract, however he missed the first three days as he \"knew there was a game on the last day\" and was not offered terms by Villa. Having joined Chelmsley Town, he was scouted by Walsall head of youth Mick Halsall, who only attended the game Deeney was playing in because his son was also playing and due to the game he was scheduled to attend being postponed. Deeney was playing while drunk, but scored seven goals in an 11\u20134 win. He was offered a trial by the then League Two club, but only attended after his Chelmsley manager got him out of bed and paid for his taxi. After signing for Walsall on 18 December 2006, Deeney was instantly sent out to Halesowen Town on loan for the rest of the 2006\u201307 season.\r\n\r\nHe scored his first professional competitive goal for Walsall against Millwall in a 2\u20131 win in September 2007. This turned out to be his only goal of the 2007\u201308 season, and the 2008\u201309 season started similarly for him, only managing two goals in the first half of the season. However, the introduction of Chris Hutchings as manager coincided with Deeney finding a goalscoring touch. Helped by the fact his new manager started playing him in his favoured striking position, instead of on the right-wing as previous manager Jimmy Mullen had, Deeney scored nine goals in Hutchings' first 12 games in charge. On 9 September 2009, it was announced that Deeney had signed a new two-year deal until 2011. In 2009\u201310 Deeney scored 14 goals to finish as Walsall's top scorer and awarded the club's Player of the Year award.\r\n\r\nIn October 2015, Deeney revealed that he had twice rejected invitations to play for Jamaica internationally and that he harboured an ambition of playing for England. Deeney is also eligible to play for Northern Ireland.",

His previous clubs include Stabio, Chiasso, Lugano, Genoa, Verona, Lazio, West Ham United, Fiorentina, and Napoli.\r\n\r\nBehrami has been capped over 60 times at international level by the Switzerland national team, playing at three World Cups and Euro 2008 since his debut in 2005.\r\n\r\nBehrami was born to Albanian parents in Titova Mitrovica, SFR Yugoslavia. When he was five, his parents both lost their jobs; his mother Halime as a secretary and his father Ragip as a manager of a plastics company. As a result, Behrami along with his parents and older sister Valentina moved to Stabio, a village in Ticino, the Italian-speaking canton of Switzerland. Behrami's mother described him as energetic: \"As a child, running was Valon's favourite pastime \u2013 he just never got tired. Even now, he can hardly sit still for a second. He always needs a ball at his feet.\"\r\n\r\nBehrami started out playing football with Swiss club sides FC Stabio, FC Chiasso and FC Lugano. After a number of impressive appearances with Lugano, he was signed by Italian team Genoa in the 2003\u201304 season, and played for them in the Serie B championship. In January 2004 he joined Udinese along with Rodrigue Boisfer in exchange for Mohammed Gargo and Vittorio Micolucci, in flopped transfer price in co-ownership deal to create \"paper\" profit.\r\n\r\nIn the 2004\u201305 season, Genoa bought out Udinese' rights to the player and loaned him out to Verona, again in Serie B.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Ben Anthony Foster (born 3 April 1983) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club West Bromwich Albion.\r\n\r\nFoster began his professional career in 2001 with Stoke City, having joined from Racing Club Warwick. However, he never made an appearance for Stoke, and spent time on loan with Bristol City, Tiverton Town, Stafford Rangers, Kidderminster Harriers and Wrexham. He switched permanently to Manchester United in July 2005, but again struggled to break into the first team, and he spent two successive seasons on loan to Watford from August 2005 until the end of the 2006\u201307 season. Having played just 23 times for Manchester United (although he also played in the Football League Cup-winning sides of 2009 and 2010), Foster switched to Birmingham City in May 2010. An ever-present in the league for Birmingham, Foster was also part of the Birmingham side who won the 2011 League Cup; he made a total of 43 appearances in that season. Following Birmingham's relegation to the Football League Championship at the end of the season, Foster was loaned to West Bromwich Albion, and moved there permanently in June 2012.\r\n\r\nInternationally, Foster made his international debut for England in February 2007 against Spain. Although he announced his retirement from international football in May 2011, he returned in February 2013, and was selected in England's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\r\n\r\nBorn in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, Foster started his football career at Racing Club Warwick in 2000. He spent a season there before he joined Stoke City on 25 April 2001 after being spotted by scout Colin Dobson. During his time at Stoke, Foster had loan spells at Bristol City, Tiverton Town, Stafford Rangers, Kidderminster Harriers and Wrexham. Foster sustained a cruciate ligament injury in June 2003 while playing tennis with his brother, which sidelined him for a period of six months. After his recovery, Foster was awarded the number 14 shirt and received his maiden call up to the Potters' first team for a First Division match versus Wimbledon on 17 January 2004. He remained on the bench for the 1-0 victory and was an unused substitute on a further six occasions during the remainder of the 2003/04 season. Foster was called into the first team squad for four matches during the 2004/05 season.\r\n\r\nFoster joined Premier League club West Bromwich Albion on 29 July 2011, changing places with Albion goalkeeper Boaz Myhill, both players signing a loan deal for the whole of the 2011\u201312 season. Foster played in 37 of their 38 league games, only missing the final game of the season with a minor groin strain. He kept 10 league clean sheets, equalling West Brom's Premier League clean sheets record, as the club finished in 10th place, their highest league finish in 30 years. At the end of the season, Foster was given the supporters' player of the year and the players' player of the year awards.\r\n\r\nOn 29 June 2012, Foster signed permanently with West Brom for an undisclosed fee, widely reported to be \u00a34 million. He signed a three-year contract with an option for a further two years in the club's favour. Foster continued to perform impressively in his second season with the club, keeping 7 clean sheets in 30 league games, and helping to guide West Brom to their record high premier league position of 8th for the 2012\u201313 season. Despite missing 4 months of the following season through injury, Foster went on to win both fans player, and player's player of the year awards for the second time in three years after a series of impressive performances throughout the 2013-14 season. Foster's impressive form for the club saw him called up to the 2014 England world cup squad, becoming the first West Bromwich Albion player to represent England in a world cup squad since Jeff Astle in 1970.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Christopher \"Chris\" Brunt (born 14 December 1984) is a Northern Irish professional footballer who plays for and is the vice-captain of Premier League club West Bromwich Albion. He plays as a left winger, as an attacking midfielder or left back. He has also played in the Football League for Sheffield Wednesday and Middlesbrough, and has appeared for Northern Ireland at youth and full international levels.\r\n\r\nBrunt was born and raised in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where he attended Newtownbreda Primary School. His father Colin was a talented rugby union player. He then went on to study at Wellington College, a grammar school in Belfast. As a youth player he appeared for Saint Andrews Boys Club.\r\n\r\nWest Bromwich Albion had a bid accepted for Brunt on 14 August 2007. They completed the signing the next day, in a \u00a33 million four-year deal, which included \u00a3500,000 of performance-related add-ons. Brunt made his Albion debut as a second-half substitute in a 2\u20130 home win over Barnsley on 1 September 2007. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20132 victory away at Scunthorpe United on 22 September 2007. Brunt's performance in the 3\u20130 home win against Plymouth Argyle on 1 March 2008 saw him named in the Championship Team of the Week. On 28 April 2008 Brunt scored a late equalising goal against Southampton in a 1\u20131 draw; this effectively secured Albion's promotion to the Premier League because of their superior goal difference. He went on to score the free-kick in West Brom's 2\u20130 win over QPR that sealed automatic promotion. Brunt was the club's top scorer in the 2008\u201309 season, scoring eight goals. Following the club's relegation, Brunt then signed a new three-year deal at the club. In the 2009/10 season, he once again helped the club reach the highest tier of English football, scoring the second goal in a 3\u20132 win over Doncaster, which sealed the club's Premier League status. In January 2011 Brunt was made the stand-in captain of West Bromwich Albion as the manager decided to drop old club captain Scott Carson. When the new manager came in February 2011, he confirmed that he had made Brunt the permanent captain for the club. Brunt has continued his Captaincy at WBA since the new head coach was appointed after Roy Hodgson left to manage the English national team.\r\n\r\nBrunt continued his role as West Bromwich Albion captain in the 2012/2013 and helped the team secure an 8th-place finish, the highest the club has finished in the Premier League era, while also helping to secure the record amount of points for the club (48). He scored twice in the season, his first a strike from 30 yards away at QPR which Albion won 2\u20131 and the second a finish from the edge of the box at home to Aston Villa which got Albion back into the game at 1\u20132, the final score being 2\u20132.\r\n\r\nOn 18 May 2015 Brunt was hit in the head by a ball kicked by Cesc Fabregas in a match with Chelsea which resulted in the sending off of the latter. \r\n\r\nBrunt is a current international for the Northern Ireland national team. He scored his first goal for his country in February 2009, when his free-kick helped Northern Ireland to a 3\u20130 victory over San Marino.\r\n\r\nIn April 2012 it was revealed that Brunt was in manager Stuart Pearce's provisional squad for the 2012 Olympic Great Britain football team. He was in the end not selected in the final 18-man squad for the Games.",

He impressed enough at Sincil Bank to earn a move to Championship side Leicester City. He moved on to Ipswich Town in June 2008 following Leicester's relegation and then on to Premier League side West Bromwich Albion in July 2011. McAuley won West Brom's player of the year award for the 2012\u201313 season.\r\n\r\nMcAuley began his career at Linfield and spent some time in early 2000 on loan at Ballyclare Comrades. After four years at Linfield, he moved to Crusaders in the summer of 2000. After two successful seasons, he moved to Coleraine.\r\n\r\nIn May 2003, McAuley received his first senior international call when he was one of five Irish League players named in the squad for the Northern Ireland B team fixture with Scotland B on 20 May 2003. Selected in the starting eleven, the team fell to a 2\u20131 defeat in front of just 1,502 spectators at Firhill Stadium.\r\n\r\nHe received his first cap against Germany as his team lost 4\u20131 in a friendly match on 4 June 2005.\r\n\r\nMcAuley contemplated international retirement after being left out of the squad to face Sweden on 17 October 2007. But on 9 October, Nigel Worthington recalled him to the squad. McAuley made his comeback against Sweden on 17 October, drawing 1\u20131. He was also part of the squad that defeated Denmark 2\u20131 in a memorable victory on 17 November, keeping the national team's hopes of qualifying for the UEFA Euro 2008. Their hopes were dashed when they lost 1\u20130 to Spain in Las Palmas on 21 November, finishing third in Group F with twenty points. McAuley scored his first international goal against San Marino on 11 February 2009.\r\n\r\nMcAuley was called up to the Northern Ireland squad for the European qualification games against Serbia and Slovenia in March 2011. He scored his second international goal against Serbia, but could not prevent his side losing 2\u20131. For the second game, against Slovenia, McAuley was named captain for the first time. He led his side to a 0\u20130 draw, putting in a man of the match display himself at the same time.\r\n\r\nOn 4 September, McAuley scored twice for Northern Ireland in a 3-1 win against the Faroe Islands. The result put Northern Ireland at the top of Group F and on the brink of qualifying for their first European Championship.\r\n\r\nMcAuley scored the first Northern Ireland goal in a tournament for 30 years, since Colin Clarke in the 1986 World Cup, against Ukraine in Euro 2016. In addition to this making him the second-oldest scorer at the Euros, it also saw the team win for the first time at the European finals. Having made it out of the group stage, McAuley scored an own goal during the Euro 2016 round of 16 match against Wales, that resulted in Northern Ireland being eliminated from the tournament.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Thomas Henry Alex \"Hal\" Robson-Kanu (born 21 May 1989) is a professional footballer who plays for Reading as a winger.\r\n\r\nRobson-Kanu started his career as a schoolboy at Arsenal but was released at 15 and joined Reading. After graduating from the Academy in 2007 he spent time on loan at Southend United and Swindon Town before returning to Reading and making his first team debut in 2009. Limited to mainly substitute appearances during his first season, he became an important member of the squad appearing regularly during the 2011\u201312 Championship winning campaign. He made his Premier League debut in 2012 and has since gone on to make over 100 appearances for the club.\r\n\r\nAt international level Robson-Kanu initially represented the country of his birth, England, at under-19 and under-20 level. In 2010 he switched allegiance to Wales, the country of his grandmother, playing for the under-21 side before his debut for the senior team against Croatia on 23 May that year. He scored his first senior international goal against Scotland in March 2013 and his second against Cyprus in October 2014.\r\n\r\nBorn in Acton, London, Robson-Kanu began his career at Arsenal as a schoolboy aged 10. He was released by the club at 15 and joined Reading after speaking to then Academy manager Brendan Rodgers. After graduating from the Academy he signed his first professional contract in July 2007, penning a two-year deal with the club. The 2007 Peace Cup in South Korea saw Robson-Kanu involved with the Reading senior team for the first time with appearances against River Plate and Shimizu S-Pulse. Steve Coppell's policy of resting first-team players for cup matches saw Robson-Kanu selected on the bench for the first time on 5 January 2008 for the FA Cup third round tie against Tottenham Hotspur, though he remained an unused substitute.\r\n\r\nNot in contention for a regular place in the Reading first team, Robson-Kanu's first experience of senior football came on 30 January 2008 when he joined Southend United on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut three days later as a second-half substitute in a 2\u20132 draw away at Leyton Orient and scored his first career goal against Nottingham Forest. He struck twice more in the next two games against Huddersfield Town and Swansea City and returned to Reading with three goals in eight appearances. Robson-Kanu was again involved in the first team during the 2008\u201309 pre-season, scoring a goal in a 9\u20130 win over Didcot Town in July. He re-joined Southend on a month's loan on 21 August 2008 and after one goal in six appearances extended his spell for a second month. He returned to Reading on 15 November after his three-month spell came to an end having made 15 appearances, scoring twice, during his second spell at the club.\r\n\r\nAfter returning to Reading he was among the substitutes for the FA Cup third round tie against Cardiff City on 3 January 2009. He would again have to wait to make his debut though, remaining on the bench as Cardiff won the match. On 26 January 2009 he joined Swindon Town on a one month loan which, after six games, was extended for a further month. Midway through his spell at Swindon, having impressed on loan at the club as well with Southend previously, he signed a new contract with Reading until 2011. He cemented a regular place in the Swindon team and started in all 20 of his appearances for the club before returning to Reading after three months. At the conclusion of his spell Swindon boss Danny Wilson hailed Robson-Kanu and fellow loanee Gordon Greer for their \"fantastic impression\" which helped the club pull away from relegation.\r\n\r\nRobson-Kanu initially represented England, the country of his birth, at international level, making his debut for the under-19 side against Germany in November 2007. He made a second appearance against Croatia the following year before winning one cap for the England under-20s against Montenegro in 2009.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 he switched allegiance to Wales who he qualifies for through his grandmother. He was first selected in the Wales under-21s squad for the friendly against Austria on 18 May 2010 and made his debut in a 1\u20130 defeat. Robson-Kanu's first cap for the senior team came just five days later, coming on as a second half substitute for Robert Earnshaw in a 2\u20130 loss to Croatia. He continued to play for the under-21's after his senior debut and made a further three appearances, scoring twice, with his last appearance coming in a defeat to Italy which ended Wales hopes of qualifying for the European Under-21 Football Championships. He scored his first senior international goal on 22 March 2013 in a 2\u20131 World Cup qualifying win over Scotland at Hampden Park.",

In 2013 he moved to Hull, initially on a temporary basis, becoming permanent at the end of the season. He earned a single cap for the England national football team in August 2012 in a friendly win against Italy.\r\n\r\nLivermore was born in Enfield, London, and he attended Enfield Grammar School.\r\n\r\nLivermore's career started in Tottenham's academy in 2006 making 39 appearances for the Under-18 team and scoring 9 goals. He made another 13 appearances for the reserves. On 29 February 2008, he joined Milton Keynes Dons on a month-long loan deal. He made his professional debut the following day in a 1\u20130 win over Chester City at stadium mk, playing the last 14 minutes in place of Jordan Hadfield. Livermore played five matches for the League Two team, all as a substitute.\r\n\r\nOn 11 July 2008, he was loaned for six months to League One side Crewe Alexandra. However, in a friendly with Conference Premier side Wrexham, he fractured his fibula and subsequently returned to Tottenham to receive treatment which kept him sidelined for a protracted spell. Livermore signed a new two-year deal with Tottenham on 24 July 2009.\r\n\r\nHe joined Championship team Derby County on an initial one-month loan on 10 August 2009. He scored his first league goal against Nottingham Forest in a 3\u20132 away defeat on the 29th. In January 2010, he joined another team in the division, Peterborough United, until the end of the 2009\u201310 season. He scored his first goal for Peterborough in a 2\u20131 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday on 23 January. On 2 March he was recalled from his loan due to a spate of injuries to the Tottenham squad. Livermore made his competitive debut for Tottenham in a 2\u20131 win against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium on 20 March, coming on in added time for Niko Kranj\u010dar.\r\n\r\nOn 23 September 2010, he was loaned out to Championship club Ipswich Town until January. On 24 March 2011 he was loaned out to Leeds United of the same division ahead of their final eight league games and battle for promotion to the Premier League. On 2 April, Livermore made his debut for Leeds as a second-half substitute against Nottingham Forest where he had a hand in Leeds' fourth goal scored by Max Gradel. He was given a start against Reading however he was substituted at half time after picking up a yellow card and lucky not to receive another for a tackle in the first half.\r\n\r\nLivermore stayed with Tottenham 2011\u201312 season, scoring his first senior goal for Spurs on 18 August 2011 in the 5\u20130 UEFA Europa League qualifying win away against Heart of Midlothian, and ultimately made 38 appearances across all competitions.\r\n\r\nLivermore moved to Hull City at the beginning of 2013\u201314 on a season-long loan, along with teammate Tom Huddlestone. He made his debut on the first day of the season when he came off the bench for Danny Graham in the 59th minute of a 2\u20130 loss away at Chelsea. On 1 December, he scored his first Premier League and Hull goal, opening a 3\u20131 home win over Liverpool with a shot deflecting off Martin \u0160krtel, Hull's first ever victory over the Merseyside opponents.\r\n\r\nHull reached the 2014 FA Cup Final, and Livermore started the game against Arsenal, which resulted in a 3\u20132 defeat at Wembley Stadium after extra time. In the close season he joined Hull permanently for an undisclosed fee, one which was reported to have broken the club transfer record.\r\n\r\nFollowing a 2\u20130 win against Crystal Palace in April 2015, Livermore was selected for a random drugs test. He tested positive for cocaine and, on 15 May 2015, was suspended by both the FA and Hull City for the remainder of the season. In August, Hull manager Steve Bruce revealed that Livermore had taken the substance to cope with the grief caused by the death of his newborn child shortly after the FA Cup final. In September 2015 a disciplinary hearing decided that the Football Association provisional ban would not be extended, as a result, his suspension by Hull City was also lifted.\r\n\r\nLivermore made his first senior appearance for England in a 2\u20131 friendly win against Italy on 15 August 2012 at the Stade de Suisse in Bern, coming on as a substitute in the 69th minute for Frank Lampard.",

He later signed for Real Betis, where he finished his formation.\r\n\r\nAdri\u00e1n spent his first two seasons with the C-team, and a further five with the reserves, four of those in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B, successively backing up Ren\u00e9 and Brimah Razak. He was also loaned to CD Alcal\u00e1, in 2008 and CD Utrera the following year. He was promoted to the first team for 2011\u201312 as third-choice \u2013 still continuing to appear for the B's \u2013 but suffered a severe injury to his cruciate ligaments in November that kept him out of action for five-and-a-half months.\r\n\r\nAdri\u00e1n made his La Liga debut on 29 September 2012, in a 0\u20134 away loss against M\u00e1laga CF: after Casto was sent off in the early minutes, he replaced out-field player Salvador Agra and went on to be named Man of the Match. Still in the 2012\u201313 campaign he became the starter, namely putting on a Man of the match performance in a 1\u20130 home win against Real Madrid on 24 November. Following his debut he went on to start the next 31 games, keeping eleven clean sheets as the club finished in seventh place and qualified to the UEFA Europa League.",

A strong and very physical centre-forward, Carroll is distinguished by his powerful aerial abilities, with West Ham manager Slaven Bilic claiming that he is \"the best in the world at heading a football.\"\r\n\r\nCarroll started his professional career with Newcastle United in 2006, before spending a brief period on loan with Preston North End, during which time he scored his first league goal. He established himself as a regular in the Newcastle first team by 2008, and following Newcastle's relegation from the Premier League to the Championship in 2009, scored 17 goals in 39 appearances to help Newcastle finish first in the league, earning immediate promotion back to the Premier League in the process. He continued to play for Newcastle in the Premier League, scoring 11 goals in 19 appearances.\r\n\r\nCarroll signed for Liverpool on the last day of the transfer window on 31 January 2011 for a fee of \u00a335 million, at the time the highest amount paid for a British footballer. Carroll was bought to replace Fernando Torres, who moved from Liverpool to Chelsea on the same day for a fee of \u00a350 million. An injury sustained in December delayed his Liverpool debut until March 2011, and he scored his first two goals for his new club in April 2011 in a 3\u20130 victory over Manchester City. In August 2012, Liverpool agreed a \u00a32 million loan deal that would see Carroll spend a season-long loan at West Ham. This move was made permanent in June 2013 for a fee of \u00a315 million.\r\n\r\nBetween 2010 and 2012, Carroll played nine games for England, scoring twice, including one goal at UEFA Euro 2012.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 (born 21 December 1989) is a Senegalese footballer who plays as a central midfielder for English club West Ham United.\r\n\r\nKouyat\u00e9 moved from Senegal to Belgium in 2006, having been offered a youth contract at RWDM Brussels. After breaking in to the first team, he went on to play just ten appearances before moving to Anderlecht aged 19. In June 2014, he joined West Ham of the Premier League. He represented the Senegal national team at the 2012 Olympics.\r\n\r\nKouyat\u00e9 began his footballing career in 1996 in his hometown with ASC Yego Dakar and was scouted by RWDM Brussels in September 2006. RWDM Brussels then signed the player in January the following year. He went on to play ten league appearances for the first team between 2007 and 2008.\r\n\r\nAs Kouyat\u00e9 turned 19, he left Brussels because his former employers did not pay him three months' worth of wages. He subsequently moved to Belgian rivals Anderlecht on a four-year deal for a free transfer. Kouyat\u00e9 went on to make 153 league appearances for Anderlecht, scoring four goals in five seasons at the club. He won the 2009\u201310, 2011\u201312, 2012\u201313 and 2013\u201314 league titles as well as the 2010\u201311, 2012\u201313 and 2013\u201314 Belgian Super Cups.\r\n\r\nOn 18 June 2014, Kouyat\u00e9 signed for West Ham United on a four-year contract. He made his West Ham debut on 16 August 2014 in a 1\u20130 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. His performance was described as \"impressive\" by the BBC. The following week, manager Sam Allardyce compared him to ex-Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira. On 28 December, Kouyat\u00e9 scored his first West Ham goal in a 1\u20132 defeat to Arsenal. His second goal of the season came on 8 February 2015 in a 1\u20131 draw with Manchester United. His performance in the game won praise from manager Allardyce for Kouyat\u00e9's Man of the Match performance which was also singled out as the Individual Performance of the Season, by a West Ham player, at the clubs' annual awards. He scored two further goals in the season, in a 2\u20132 away draw with Tottenham and in a 2\u20131 away defeat to Leicester City. Kouyat\u00e9 finished the season having played 31 out of a possible 38 Premier League games.\r\n\r\nKouyat\u00e9 was called up aged 18 to the Senegal under-20s in the same year as his RWDM Brussels debut. He scored two goals in just three games for the side in 2007.\r\n\r\nIn February 2012, Kouyat\u00e9 was called up to the Senegal senior team. In the same year, he was announced to be in the squad for Senegal Olympic football team. He played in every game as Senegal's debut appearance in the tournament ended in a knockout in the quarter-final. In January 2015, he was a member of Senegal's squad for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, held in Equatorial Guinea. Kouyat\u00e9 is the current Senegalese captain.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Diego Poyet Gonz\u00e1lez (born 8 April 1995) is a professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for West Ham United. His father is former Uruguay international footballer Gus Poyet.\r\n\r\nHe began his career at Charlton Athletic, where he was their 2013\u201314 Player of the Season despite not featuring in the first team until January. In July 2014, he was signed by West Ham, who have loaned him to Huddersfield Town, Milton Keynes Dons and Charlton.\r\n\r\nPoyet has played for England at under-16 and under-17 levels and for Uruguay at under-20 level.\r\n\r\nHaving started his career at Charlton Athletic, Poyet progress through the club's academy and by May 2013, Poyet signed his first professional contract.\r\n\r\nPoyet made his professional debut on 21 January 2014 in a 3\u20130 FA Cup third-round win over Oxford United, entering the match as an 81st-minute substitute for Dale Stephens. He made his first league start for Charlton on 1 February in a 2\u20131 defeat away to Wigan Athletic. After making these appearance, manager Chris Powell expected Poyet to make more appearances.\r\n\r\nDespite only becoming a regular in the team in February and playing just 20 league games, Poyet's performances led to him being named Charlton's Player of the Year for the 2013\u201314 season.\r\n\r\nOn 26 June 2014, Charlton announced that Poyet had indicated that he would not be signing an extension to his contract ending on 1 July 2014, and would be exploring his options elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBorn in Spain to Uruguayan parents, Poyet was raised in England after his father, Gus, signed for Chelsea in 1997. He is eligible to play for any of these three countries. In January 2014, Poyet stated that he considered himself English but would not turn down an opportunity to represent Uruguay.\r\n\r\nPoyet has represented England at under-16 and under-17 levels and was selected to take part in an England under-19 training camp in May 2014.\r\n\r\nPoyet received his first call-up to the England under-20 squad for a match with Romania on 5 September 2014, but withdrew from the squad before the game. Head coach Aidy Boothroyd subsequently stated that \"Diego hasn't decided whether he wants to play for Uruguay or not so, rather than wait for him to make his mind up, we have decided to leave him to it\".\r\n\r\nIn February 2015, the Uruguayan Football Association announced their intention to call up Poyet for two games in March 2015 against Portugal and Uzbekistan ahead of the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup. In March 2015, he made his debut for Uruguay U20, coming on as a substitute for Mauro Arambarri in a 1\u20131 draw against France U20 at Clairefontaine.\r\n\r\nPoyet is the son of Gus Poyet, a former Uruguay international footballer. With his father signed to Real Zaragoza, Poyet was born in Zaragoza in 1995.\r\n\r\nPoyet's paternal grandfather Washington was a basketball player, who captained the Uruguay national team. His uncle Marcelo also played the sport at a professional level.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Jos\u00e9 Miguel da Rocha Fonte (Portuguese pronunciation: ; born 22 December 1983) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a central defender for English club West Ham United and the Portugal national team.\r\n\r\nHe started his professional career with Sporting B, moving to England with Crystal Palace in 2007. In 2010 he signed with Southampton, where he made 288 appearances in all competitions, until he joined West Ham in January 2017.\r\n\r\nA Portuguese international since age 30, Fonte was part of the squad at Euro 2016, winning the tournament.\r\n\r\nBorn in Penafiel, Fonte finished his football education (after already having played there from ages 10\u201313) at Sporting Clube de Portugal, but only appeared with the reserves as a senior, in the third division. In 2004 he signed with S.C. Salgueiros, but the club was in severe financial difficulties and was liquidated shortly thereafter; as a result he terminated his contract and transferred to F.C. Felgueiras, in the Segunda Liga.\r\n\r\nIn the 2005 off-season, Fonte made his Primeira Liga debut with Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal, where his performances attracted the eye of S.L. Benfica, who signed him in January 2006, immediately loaning him out to fellow league side F.C. Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira; he finished the season with 26 league appearances and one goal, as both Pa\u00e7os and Set\u00fabal managed to maintain their division status.\r\n\r\nFonte spent the 2006\u201307 season on loan to C.F. Estrela da Amadora, still in the top division, only missing five league games as the Lisbon-based club finished in ninth position.\r\n\r\nFonte signed for Southampton on 9 January 2010 for a fee believed to be around the region of \u00a31.2 million, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract. He made his debut one week later alongside two other recent signings, Jon Otsemobor and Danny Seaborne, in a 1\u20131 draw at Millwall; his first goal for the Saints came on 28 August 2010, in a 4\u20130 away win against Bristol Rovers.\r\n\r\nAfter scoring seven league goals and helping Southampton gain promotion to the second level, Fonte was named in the League One Team of the Year for the 2010\u201311 season. He was also voted Southampton's Player of Year, achieving 64% of the overall vote, with Adam Lallana coming second with 18% and Dan Harding finishing third (7%).\r\n\r\nOn 29 December 2011, Fonte signed a new contract keeping him at the club until 2015. Southampton were top of the table when he signed, with the player having appeared in every league game, and he eventually contributed with 42 matches and one goal (against Coventry City in the final matchday) as the side achieved a second consecutive promotion.\r\n\r\nFonte made his debut in the Premier League on 19 August 2012, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2\u20133 away loss against Manchester City. He netted his first Premier League goal(s) in a 2\u20132 home draw against Fulham on 7 October, the second arriving in the last minute; on 24 August 2013, he scored a header in the 89th minute of the home game against Sunderland, rescuing a point for his team.\r\n\r\nOn 23 January 2014, Fonte was attacked by teammate Dani Osvaldo during a training session. Subsequently, the latter was loaned out to Juventus F.C. during the winter transfer window.\r\n\r\nOn 8 August 2014, Fonte penned a new three-year deal with Southampton running until 2017, and was also named team captain.\r\n\r\nFonte was called up to the Portuguese under-21 squad for the Vale do Tejo tournament in 2006. On 24 January he played against Slovenia, as the match ended with a penalty shootout loss after a 1\u20131 draw.\r\n\r\nOn 3 October 2014, at nearly 31, Fonte received his first call-up to the full side, for a friendly with France and a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier against Denmark. He made his debut in another exhibition game, playing the second half of a 1\u20130 win over Argentina at Old Trafford on 18 November.\r\n\r\nFonte was selected by manager Fernando Santos for his Euro 2016 squad. His first game in the tournament took place on 25 June, as he started alongside Southampton teammate C\u00e9dric Soares in the round-of-16 clash against Croatia (1\u20130 triumph after extra time); he went on to retain his position until the final, won at the expense of hosts France.\r\n\r\nFonte's younger brother, Rui, is also a footballer. A forward, the two were teammates at Sporting (youth) and Crystal Palace.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Manuel Lanzini (born 15 February 1993) is an Argentine footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for English club West Ham United. He has previously played for River Plate and Fluminense and international football for Argentina U20. He is described as possessing phenomenal dribbling ability, as well as fantastic acceleration and vision and the ability to ghost past defenders. He is nicknamed \"the jewel\" (\"la joya\") and holds an Italian passport.\r\n\r\nBorn in Ituzaing\u00f3, Buenos Aires, Lanzini made his professional debut for River Plate as a 17-year-old on August 8, 2010, in a 1\u20130 home win over Tigre, playing 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nLanzini spent the 2011\u201312 season on-loan with Fluminense in Brazil. He scored his debut goal on 1 September 2011, in a 2\u20131 victory over S\u00e3o Paulo, at the Est\u00e1dio do Morumbi. He went on to play 37 games in all competitions, scoring five goals and won the 2012 Carioca.\r\n\r\nHe returned from a loan in the summer of 2012 and took the number 10 shirt. He scored his first goal for the club in a 1\u20132 home defeat to Belgrano, in the first game of the season.\r\n\r\nIn 2014 Lanzini became the youngest foreign player, at 21, to play in the UAE Arabian Gulf League when he signed a four-year deal for Al Jazira Club. He had been courted by clubs in England, Spain, Italy and Turkey, and was signed as a replacement for Marseille-bound Abdelaziz Barrada.\r\n\r\nOn 22 July 2015, Lanzini signed for Premier League side West Ham United on a season-long loan, with an option to make the move permanent. He made his debut on 6 August in a UEFA Europa League third qualifying round second leg away to FC Astra Giurgiu, starting the match and scoring in the third minute, but the team lost 2\u20131 (4\u20133 on aggregate) and were eliminated. His league debut came on 15 August as a 76th-minute substitute for Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 in a 1\u20132 home defeat to Leicester City. On 29 August, he scored his first league goal within three minutes of kick-off away to Liverpool, and assisted a Mark Noble goal after exploiting poor defending by Dejan Lovren, as the Hammers won 3\u20130 for their first victory at Anfield since 1963. In March 2016, a permanent deal to sign Lanzini with effect from 1 July 2016 was announced by West Ham.\r\n\r\nIn May 2016, Lanzini was named in Argentina's provisional 35-man squad for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. He withdrew from the squad in July 2016 following a knee injury sustained while training in Miami, Florida. He returned to London for treatment and training with West Ham.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Mark James Noble (born 8 May 1987) is an English footballer who plays as a central midfielder and is captain of West Ham United. He has played almost all his youth and first team football for West Ham apart from two short loan spells, at Hull City and Ipswich Town. He has played for England at U16, U17, U18, U19 and U21 levels. He captained the U21 side, scoring three goals in 20 appearances. Noble is the longest serving player in West Ham's current squad, having been in the first team since 2004. He is West Ham's first-choice taker for penalty kicks and has won the club's Hammer of the Year trophy twice. In 2014, he was ranked in the top five penalty takers in the top European leagues and was in the top 10 in the world based on the percentage of penalties successfully converted since 2009. Noble has played more Premier League games for West Ham than any other player.\r\n\r\nBorn in Canning Town, East London, Noble played for Barking Colts and moved to Arsenal's academy at age 11. However, his father, who would drive him to training, could not always arrange the time to get Noble to training sessions due to the distance from their home in Beckton. Local side West Ham United showed an interest and Noble signed as a youth player. He became the youngest player ever to appear in their reserve team, aged 15. He became a trainee in July 2003 and made his debut in the senior team at the age of just 17 in the League Cup in August 2004 in a 2\u20130 win against Southend. He made his league debut in the Championship in January 2005, in a 4\u20132 defeat away at Wolves. On 30 May 2005 Noble played in the 2005 Football League Championship play-off Final which saw West Ham beat Preston North End, 1\u20130 to return to the Premier League. He had entered the game as an 82nd-minute substitute for Shaun Newton.\r\n\r\nNoble captained the England U18 team. He was a member of the England U19 team that beat Serbia and Montenegro U19s 3\u20131 in the 2005 European Championship semi-finals, although they subsequently lost the final to France.\r\n\r\nNoble made his debut for the England U-21 team on 11 June 2007, coming on as substitute in the 82nd-minute for Tom Huddlestone in England's 0\u20130 draw with the Czech Republic during the European under-21 Championships in the Netherlands. He established himself in the starting eleven for the remaining matches and scored twice in a dramatic semi-final penalty shootout against the Netherlands where they lost 13\u201312. On 11 September 2007, Noble scored his first international goal, for the Under-21 team, against Bulgaria, in a 2\u20130 victory, followed by two more against the Republic of Ireland on 16 October.\r\n\r\nNoble captained the U21s at the 2009 European Championships as regular captain Steven Taylor had to withdraw due to injury. The Young Lions ended the tournament as runners-up, losing 4\u20130 to Germany, with Noble playing his last match for the U21s.\r\n\r\nNoble is also eligible to play for the Republic of Ireland national side through his Cork born grandparents. In August 2014, despite stating on numerous occasions about his ambition of playing for England, it has been reported that he has made himself available for the Irish national team.",

At Grasshopper he rose through the youth ranks at the club, soon playing regularly for the reserves. He was unable to establish himself in their first team and was sent out on a short loan to FC Wil early in the 2011\u20132012 season though he did not make an appearance for the team. Spiegel returned to Grasshopper only to be sent on loan again, this time to SC Br\u00fchl for the rest of the season. He made his debut for Br\u00fchl on 6 November 2011 against FC Locarno in a 2\u20131 away loss. After a successful run in the first team during his loan at Br\u00fchl, Spiegel returned to Grasshopper.\r\n\r\nOn 23 July 2012, Spiegel signed for West Ham United after their return to the English Premier League, for an undisclosed fee. After joining West Ham United, Spiegel featured in games for the Under-21 squad and was a reserve goalkeeper, working as an understudy to Jussi J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen and Adri\u00e1n.\r\n\r\nOn 18 July 2014 he signed for Crawley Town on a one-month loan deal until 16 August 2014 before returning to West Ham without having played for Crawley. On 25 November 2014 he signed on a one-month loan for Barnet making his debut the same day in a 2\u20131 away defeat to Bristol Rovers. This was his only appearance before his loan spell was cut short due to injury.\r\n\r\nOn 20 February 2015 Spiegel signed for Carlisle United on an initial one-month loan deal. He made his debut the following day in a 3\u20132 home defeat by Wycombe Wanderers. He returned to West Ham on 23 March 2015 having made two appearances for Carlisle.\r\n\r\nSpiegel is currently a Switzerland youth international. In 2009 he was part of the Swiss under-17 team that won the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup beating the host nation Nigeria 1\u20140 in the final. He remained an unused substitute throughout the tournament though, unable to displace Swiss first choice Benjamin Siegrist who would go on to win the Golden Glove.[11",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Robert Snodgrass (born 7 September 1987) is a Scottish professional footballer who plays as a winger for Premier League club West Ham United. He can also play as a forward. After playing for Scotland at various youth levels including under-21s, Snodgrass received a call up to the Scotland national team side in 2009, and won his first cap in February 2011.\r\n\r\nSnodgrass started his senior career with Livingston. He also had a loan spell at Stirling Albion before moving to England in 2008, joining Leeds United. He helped Leeds win promotion to the Championship in 2010. In February 2012, Snodgrass was appointed captain of Leeds, but he rejected a new contract offer and moved to Norwich City in July.\r\n\r\nBorn in Glasgow, Snodgrass grew up in the Gallowgate area, the youngest of three boys (Steven and Tony) and two girls (Michelle and Tracey). His boyhood club, Celtic, offered him an apprenticeship, along with Clyde and Livingston. He felt that he had little chance of breaking through at Parkhead, so chose Livingston.\r\n\r\nSnodgrass started his career at Livingston, where he scored 15 goals in 79 games. Snodgrass caught attention by turning down a trial with Spanish giants Barcelona. Before he turned professional, he was offered a move to Blackburn Rovers, though he chose to stay with Livingston. After recovering from a broken metatarsal, he moved to Stirling Albion on loan for the remainder of the 2006\u201307 season on 30 January 2007 to step up his recovery from injury.\r\n\r\nSnodgrass established himself as a regular first-team member during the 2005\u201306 season. This was a campaign of mixed fortunes, as he gained regular first-team football, yet his side were relegated to Division 1. During Livingston's first season in the second tier, he scored ten goals for Livingston in the Scottish First Division during the 2007\u201308 season; he was offered a new contract at Livingston, but turned it down. After failing to impress during a trial spell with Barnsley, he joined League One team Leeds United in July 2008. He left the Lions scoring 15 goals in 79 games.\r\n\r\nOn 30 June 2014, Hull City signed Snodgrass for an undisclosed fee, believed to exceed \u00a36 million, on a three-year contract. Snodgrass dislocated a kneecap during a 1\u20130 win at Queens Park Rangers in August 2014. The injury, which required surgery to heal, was initially expected to keep Snodgrass out of action for several months. A month later, it was reported that he would be out of action for the entirety of the 2014\u201315 season. Snodgrass made his first appearance in a game since the injury in November 2015, playing in an under-21 Premier League Cup match. His first return to first-team action was in the League Cup away to Manchester City on 1 December 2015 when he came on as a replacement for Sone Aluko in the 73rd-minute. On 9 January 2016, in the third-round of the FA Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion, he scored a penalty to take the team through the next round.",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Sofiane Feghouli (Arabic: \u0633\u0641\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a\u063a\u0648\u0644\u064a\u200e\u200e; born 26 December 1989) is a professional footballer who plays for English club West Ham United and the Algeria national team. He operates mainly as a winger, but can also play as an attacking midfielder.\r\n\r\nFeghouli made his senior international debut for Algeria in February 2012. He represented Algeria at the 2013 and 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, where he scored Algeria's first goal in the competition.\r\n\r\nFeghouli began his career with Grenoble, after French team Paris Saint-Germain declined to sign him after a trial. For the latter portion of the 2006\u20132007 season, he was promoted to the first-team squad and given the number 33 shirt. He made his highly anticipated debut, at the age of 17, for the club on 27 April 2007 in a Ligue 2 match against Reims, appearing as a substitute. Grenoble won the match 1\u20130. He made two more appearances that season, including his first start on the final match day of the season against Montpellier on 25 May 2007. Montpellier won the match 1\u20130 with Feghouli playing 56 minutes before being subbed out. On 31 May 2007, he signed his first professional contract with Grenoble, keeping him with the side until 2010.\r\n\r\nThe following season, he was handed the number 8 shirt and, despite being 17 years of age, was given a more important role in the first-team squad. Despite having the pressure of being labelled the \"new Zidane\", his contribution to the squad was successful, appearing in 27 matches and scoring three goals, helping Grenoble achieve promotion to Ligue 1. His first career goal came on 18 January 2008 in a 4\u20133 away victory against Reims, the club he faced on his debut.\r\n\r\nFeghouli returned for the 2009\u201310 season, making his debut on 29 August 2009 in a 1\u20130 defeat to Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes rivals Saint-\u00c9tienne. After appearing in five more matches, it was discovered by Grenoble officials that Feghouli had torn the meniscus in his right knee. The knee was successfully operated on in October. Following the surgery, Grenoble officials, most notably CEO Pierre Wantiez, were extremely critical of the player. Wantiez questioned Feghouli's long delay in returning to the team and the player's motives regarding a transfer as Feghouli would be out of contract in the summer and was already talking to several clubs, most notably Spanish club Valencia. Wantiez attributed Feghouli's recent moves to \"bad advice\" from the player's agent.",
