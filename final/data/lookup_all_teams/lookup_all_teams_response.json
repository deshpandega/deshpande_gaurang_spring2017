Milita nella massima serie del calcio inglese ininterrottamente dal 1919-1920, risultando quindi la squadra da pi\u00f9 tempo presente in First Division/Premier League. \u00c8 la prima squadra della capitale del Regno Unito per successi sportivi e, in ambito federale, la terza dopo Manchester United e Liverpool, essendosi aggiudicata nel corso della sua storia tredici campionati inglesi, dodici FA Cup (record di vittorie, condiviso con il Manchester United), due League Cup e quattordici Community Shield (una condivisa),[5] mentre in ambito internazionale ha conquistato una Coppa delle Coppe ed una Coppa delle Fiere. Inoltre \u00e8 una delle tredici squadre che hanno raggiunto le finali di tutte le tre principali competizioni gestite dalla UEFA: Champions League (2005-2006), Coppa UEFA (1999-2000) e Coppa delle Coppe (1979-1980, 1993-1994 e 1994-1995).[6]\r\n\r\nI colori sociali, rosso per la maglietta e bianco per i pantaloncini, hanno sub\u00ecto variazioni pi\u00f9 o meno evidenti nel corso degli anni.

Lo stemma \u00e8 stato modificato ripetutamente, ma al suo interno \u00e8 sempre comparso almeno un cannone. Proprio per questo motivo i giocatori ed i tifosi dell'Arsenal sono spesso soprannominati Gunners (in italiano \"cannonieri\").\r\n\r\nL'Arsenal conta su una schiera di tifosi molto nutrita, distribuita in ogni parte del mondo.

With a capacity of 60,272, the Emirates is the third-largest football stadium in England after Wembley and Old Trafford.In 1997, Arsenal explored the possibility of relocating to a new stadium, having been denied planning permission by Islington Council to expand its home ground of Highbury. After considering various options (including purchasing Wembley), the club bought an industrial and waste disposal estate in Ashburton Grove in 2000. A year later they won the council's approval to build a stadium on the site; manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger described this as the \"biggest decision in Arsenal's history\" since the board appointed Herbert Chapman. Relocation began in 2002, but financial difficulties delayed work until February 2004. Emirates Airline was later announced as the main sponsor for the stadium. Work was completed in 2006 at a cost of \u00a3390 million.",

The club plays at Dean Court in Kings Park, Boscombe, Bournemouth, Dorset and have been in existence since 1899.\r\n\r\nNicknamed The Cherries, the team traditionally played in red shirts with white sleeves until 1971, when the strip was changed to red and black stripes, similar to that of A.C. Milan. A predominantly red shirt was chosen for the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 seasons before announcing a return to the stripes for the 2006\u201307 season due to fan demand.\r\n\r\nAfter narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League in the 2008\u201309 season, Bournemouth were promoted to League One at the end of the 2009\u201310. After making the League One play-off semi-finals in 2010\u201311 and achieving a mid-table finish in 2011\u201312, Bournemouth won promotion to the Championship at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, putting them in the second tier of the league for only the second time in their history.\r\n\r\nAlthough the exact date of the club's foundation is not known, there is proof that it was formed in the autumn of 1899 out of the remains of the older Boscombe St. John's Lads\u2019 Institute F.C. The club was originally known as Boscombe F.C.. The first President was Mr. J.C. Nutt.\r\n\r\nIn their first season 1889\u201390 Boscombe F.C. competed in the Bournemouth and District Junior League. They also played in the Hants Junior Cup. During the first two seasons they played on a football pitch in Castlemain Avenue, Pokesdown. From their third season the team played on a pitch in King's Park. In the season of 1905\u201306 Boscombe F.C. graduated to senior amateur football.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the club was granted a long lease upon some wasteland next to Kings Park, as the clubs football ground, by their president Mr. J.E. Cooper-Dean. With their own ground, named Dean Court after the benefactor, the club continued to thrive and dominated the local football scene. Also in 1910 the club signed their first professional football player B. Penton.\r\n\r\nAround about this time the club obtained their nickname 'The Cherries'. Foremost there are two tales on how the club gained this pet name. First, because of the cherry-red striped shirts that the team played in and, perhaps more plausible, because Dean Court was built adjacent to the Cooper-Dean estate, which encompassed numerous cherry orchards.\r\n\r\nFor the first time during the season of 1913\u201314 the club competed in the F.A. Cup. The clubs progress was halted in 1914 with the outbreak of the war and Boscombe F.C. returned to the Hampshire league.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 the Third Division was formed and Boscombe were promoted to the Southern League, with moderate success.",

      "strStadiumDescription": "Dean Court, known as the Goldsands Stadium for sponsorship purposes, is a football stadium in Bournemouth, England and the home ground of A.F.C. Bournemouth.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 Boscombe F.C. was given a piece of land by the town's Cooper-Dean family, after whom the ground was named. The land was the site of an old gravel pit, and the ground was not built in time for the start of the 1910\u201311 season. As a result, the club played at the adjacent King's Park until moving into Dean Court in December 1910. However, the club facilities were still not ready, and players initially had to change in a nearby hotel. Early developments at the ground included a 300-seat stand.\r\n\r\nIn 1923 the club were elected to Division Three South of the Football League, at which point they changed their name to Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic. The first Football League match was played at Dean Court on 1 September 1923, with 7,000 watching a 0\u20130 draw with Swindon Town. Subsequent ground improvements were made following the purcase of fittings from the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, which allowed the construction of a 3,700-seat stand. A covered terrace was added at the southern end of the ground in 1936.\r\n\r\nThe club's record League attendance was set on 14 April 1948, when 25,495 watched a 1\u20130 defeat to QPR. The overall record attendance was set on 2 March 1957, when 28,799 spectators watched an FA Cup match against Manchester United. Shortly afterwards, a roof was added to the western stand. The club also purchased more land behind the northern end of the ground, with the intention of enlarging the stand and building a leisure centre. However, the club ran out of money during its construction and abandoned the scheme in 1984. As a result, the half-built structure was demolished and housing was built on that part of the site. The club's lowest Football League attendance was set on 4 March 1986, when only 1,873 saw a 2\u20132 drawn with Lincoln City.\r\n\r\nThe ground was completely rebuilt in 2001, with the pitch rotated ninety degrees from its original position and the ground moved away from adjacent housing. Because the work was not finished in time for the start of the 2001\u201302 season, Bournemouth played their first eight games at the Avenue Stadium in nearby Dorchester. When Dean Court reopened with a game against Wrexham on 10 November, it gained its first sponsored name, becoming the Fitness First Stadium. Although it was rebuilt as a three sided stadium with a capacity of 9,600, seats were placed on the undeveloped south end in the autumn of 2005. On 24 February 2004 Bournemouth's James Hayter scored the Football League's fastest-ever hat-trick at Dean Court, scoring three goals in 2 minutes and 20 seconds during a 6\u20130 against Wrexham. The club sold the stadium in December 2005 in a sale-and-leaseback deal with London property company Structadene.\r\n\r\nIn the 2010\u201311 a temporary south stand was built, but was removed during the 2011\u201312 season after attendances fell. In July 2011 the stadium was renamed the Seward Stadium after the naming rights were sold to the Seward Motor Group. Following Seward entering administration in February 2012, the ground was subsequently renamed the Goldsands Stadium in a two-year deal. During the summer of 2013 a 2,400 seat stand was built on the undeveloped end of the ground as a result of the club's promotion to the Championship. In July 2013 it was named after former club striker Ted MacDougall.",

Nicknamed The Clarets, due to the dominant colour of their home shirts, they were one of the founder members of the Football League in 1888. The club colours of claret and blue were adopted in 1910 in tribute to the dominant club of English football at the time, Aston Villa. It was thought the colours might lift and inspire Burnley to emulate the aforementioned side. Their home ground since 1883 has been Turf Moor.\r\n\r\nBurnley have been Football League Champions twice, in 1920\u201321 and 1959\u201360, and have won the FA Cup once, in 1914.

From 1985 to 1992 they had a seven-year spell in the lowest tier of the Football League. In 1987 they narrowly avoided relegation to the Conference.

      "strStadiumDescription": "Turf Moor is a football stadium in Burnley, Lancashire, England. It is the home ground of Premier League side Burnley Football Club, who have played there since moving from its Calder Vale ground in 1883. The stadium, which is situated on Harry Potts Way, named so after the club's longest serving Manager, has a capacity of 21,401, all seated. It was one of the last remaining stadiums in England to have the players' tunnel and dressing rooms behind one of the goals, until it was covered for seating in time for the 2014-15 Premier League season and rebuilt between the David Fishwick and James Hargreaves stand. The ground originally consisted of just a pitch and the first grandstand was not built until 1885. Six years after this, the \"Star\" stand was erected and terracing was later added to the ends of the ground. After the Second World War, the stadium was redeveloped with all four stands being rebuilt. During the 1990s, the ground underwent further refurbishment when the Longside and Bee Hole End terraces were replaced by all-seater stands. Currently, the four stands at Turf Moor are the James Hargreaves Stand, the Jimmy McIlroy Stand, the Bob Lord Stand and the Cricket Field Stand.\r\n\r\nBurnley played their first match at the ground on 17 February 1883, losing 3\u20136 to local side Rawtenstall. When Prince Albert Victor opened a new hospital in Burnley in 1886, Turf Moor became the first football ground to be visited by a member of the British Royal Family. The first Football League match at the ground took place on 6 October 1888, with Fred Poland scoring the first competitive goal at the stadium. The record attendance at Turf Moor was set in 1924 when 54,755 people attended an FA Cup tie between Burnley and Huddersfield Town. In the same year, Turf Moor hosted its only FA Cup semi-final to date. In 1927, the stadium was the venue of an international match between England and Wales. Since then, the ground has been used to host matches in the European Under-19 Championship and European Under-21 Championship fixtures.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, plans for expansion of Turf Moor were released to the public. The Burnley directors proposed a major development of the stadium, costing \u00a320 million. The plans, which would incorporate the rebuilding of the Cricket Field Stand and the moving of the players' entrance tunnel, have been put on hold until the current financial climate improves. In 2009, following Burnley's promotion to the Premier League, the development of a second tier on the Bob Lord stand was announced. Director Paul Fletcher stated that the anticipated capacity of Turf Moor would eventually be 28,000 to cope with extra fans. However following the club's relegation from the Premier League in 2010, these plans were put on hold indefinitely.\r\n\r\nAfter again achieving promotion to the Premier League in 2014 further Ground renovations were undertaken to comply with new regulations include housing for International Media, relocation of the players tunnel and upgrades to seating in the David Fishwick Stand for away supporters. On 26 June 2014 the club unveiled a planning application for extensions to the Turf Moor front entrance including the rebuilding of the official Club Shop containing a first floor museum.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Crystal Palace Football Club is an English professional football club based in South Norwood, London. They currently play in the highest level in English football, the Premier League. Since 1964, the club have mostly played in the top two leagues of English football. The club was founded in 1905 at the site of the famous Crystal Palace Exhibition building by the owners of the FA Cup Final stadium, who wanted their own team to play at the historic venue. Palace applied to be elected to The Football League, but this was rejected and they instead joined the Southern Football League Second Division, playing home games at The Crystal Palace, inspiration for the club's initial nickname, \"The Glaziers\". Palace won the Division and promotion in their first season, and played in the Southern League First Division for the next fifteen years.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 the Southern League Division One formed the Football League Third Division. Palace won the division and gained promotion to the Second Division, where they spent four seasons before suffering relegation to the Third Division South. In 1958 a league re-organisation saw Palace become founder members of Division Four. Over the next eleven years the club moved from the lowest rung of English Football to the highest, reaching the First Division in 1969, and staying in the top division for four seasons before suffering successive relegations. In 1973 the club modernised its image, changing the nickname from The Glaziers to \"The Eagles\" and ending the 68-year association with claret and blue by introducing the red-and-blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. The club stabilised itself in the top two divisions with promotions in 1977 and 1979, the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two Champions. The period between 1989\u201391 was a successful time for the club. They reached an FA Cup Final in 1990, won the Full Members Cup in 1991, and achieved third place in the top division in the 1990\u20131991 season. Palace became founder members of the Premier League in 1992, but were relegated the same season, despite achieving 49 points which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. The club then achieved promotion back to the Premier League three times in 1994, 1997 and 2004, but each time suffered relegation at the end of the following season. Palace entered administration in both 2000 and 2010, and are now owned by a consortium of four. The club were promoted back to the Premier League with a 1\u20130 win over Watford in the Football League play-offs in May 2013.\r\n\r\nCrystal Palace initially played their games in the grounds of The Crystal Palace, but the First World War saw them forced to move out, and they enjoyed a number of seasons at both the Herne Hill Velodrome and The Nest. Since 1924, Palace have played their home games at Selhurst Park. Their home colours are red and blue vertical stripes, though prior to 1973 they wore claret and pale blue after the fashion of Aston Villa. They have a fierce rivalry with M23 neighbours Brighton & Hove Albion, with whom they have contested the M23 derby 98 times and also enjoy a strong rivalry with fellow South London team Millwall. The club's kit is currently made by Macron, and the shirt sponsor is Neteller. The club captain is Mile Jedinak and the current player of the year is Julian Speroni. Edmund Goodman is the club's longest serving manager, and Jim Cannon has made the most appearances for the club. Peter Simpson is the club's top scorer for both one season and overall, netting 54 and 165 respectively. The highest transfer fee received has been for Wilfried Zaha from Manchester United in January 2013.",

      "strStadiumDescription": "Selhurst Park is an association football stadium located in the London suburb of South Norwood in the Borough of Croydon. It is the current home ground of Crystal Palace Football Club playing in the Premier League.\r\n\r\nIn 1922 the site, a former brickfield, was bought from the Brighton Railway Company for \u00a32,570. The stadium (designed by Scottish stadium architect Archibald Leitch) was constructed by Humphreys of Kensington (a firm regularly used by Leitch) for around \u00a330,000, and was officially opened by the Lord Mayor of London on 30 August 1924. There was then only one stand (the present Main Stand), but this was unfinished due to industrial action; Crystal Palace played Sheffield Wednesday and lost 0\u20131 in front of 25,000 fans.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in 1926, England played Wales in an international at the stadium. England amateur matches and various other finals were also staged there, as were other sports including boxing, bicycle polo (in the late 1940s) and cricket and music concerts (in the 1980s). In addition to this, it hosted two games for the 1948 Summer Olympics.\r\n\r\nIn 1953, the stadium's first floodlights were installed consisting of numerous poles around the 3 sides of terracing and four roof mounted installations on the Main Stand, but were replaced nine years later by floodlights mounted on, pylons in each corner and six installations on the Main Stand roof. Real Madrid marked the occasion by playing the first game under the new set of bulbs \u2013 a real footballing coup at the time for third division Palace, as it was Real's first ever match in London.",

Following four league titles and two FA Cup wins, Everton experienced a lull in the immediate post World War Two period until a revival in the 1960s which saw the club win two league championships and an FA Cup. The mid-1980s represented their most recent period of sustained success, with two League Championship successes, an FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup. The club's most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup. The club's supporters are known as Evertonians.\r\n\r\nEverton have a rivalry with neighbours Liverpool and the two sides contest the Merseyside derby.

The stadium is built in a residential area served by regular rail and bus services two miles (3 km) from Liverpool city centre.\r\n\r\nGoodison has undergone many changes over the years and it presently has an all-seated capacity of 39,572. Everton fans refer to the stadium as \"The Grand Old Lady\" and the abridged \"Goodison\".\r\n\r\nIt has hosted more top-flight games than any other stadium in England. Goodison has hosted the maximum number of league games since the Premier League was formed in 1992, as Everton have remained in the top tier of English football since 1954. The club has only been outside the top division for four seasons, having only been relegated twice (in 1930 and 1951).\r\n\r\nAs well as hosting Everton games, the stadium has been the venue for an FA Cup Final and numerous international fixtures, including several in the 1966 FIFA World Cup. The record for the highest attendance in women's football was set at Goodison Park in 1920, which stood for 92 years until 31 July 2012. This game's high attendance resulted in women's football being banned by the Football Association for 50 years as they felt it threatened the men's game.\r\n\r\nGoodison Park was conceived in unusual circumstances: two factions of politicians on the Everton board grappled to control the destiny of the club. A split emerged with the members with the majority leaving their home at Anfield forming Goodison Park. Everton F.C.'s relocation to Goodison Park was one of the earliest cases of a team moving to a new stadium for monetary benefit.",

The first was the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, during which charging Liverpool fans caused a crush that resulted in a wall collapsing and the death of 39 Juventus supporters, after which English clubs were banned from European competition for five years. In the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, 96 Liverpool supporters lost their lives in a crush against perimeter fencing.\r\n\r\nLiverpool has long-standing rivalries with neighbours Everton and with Manchester United.

A statue of Shankly is situated outside the stadium. The ground is 2 miles (3 km) from Liverpool Lime Street railway station.\r\n\r\nIt was proposed in 2002 to replace the stadium with a new one in the adjacent Stanley Park, but after the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group in 2010 it was made clear this would not happen.\r\n\r\nConstruction for an extension to the Main Stand began on Monday, December 8th, 2014.

The work is due to be completed by the beginning of the 2015/16 football season with capacity increasing to over 55,000. The expansion will coincide with development immediately adjacent to the stadium and the completion of the Etihad Campus training facility, Connell Sixth Form College and community hub which is partly funded by Manchester City.",

They are regarded as one of the most successful clubs in English football.\r\n\r\nManchester United have won the most League titles (20) of any English club, a joint record 11 FA Cups, four League Cups, and a record 20 FA Community Shields. The club has also won three European Cups, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup, and one FIFA Club World Cup. In 1998\u201399, the club won a continental treble of the Premier League, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League.\r\n\r\nThe 1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, Manchester United was the first English football club to win the European Cup.

It is about 0.5 miles (800 m) from Old Trafford Cricket Ground and the adjacent tram station.\r\n\r\nOld Trafford, nicknamed the Theatre of Dreams by Bobby Charlton, has been United's home ground since 1910, although from 1941 to 1949, as a result of bomb damage during the Second World War, the club shared Maine Road with local rivals Manchester City. Old Trafford underwent several expansions in the 1990s and 2000s, including the addition of extra tiers to the North, West and East Stands, which served to return the ground almost to its original capacity of 80,000. Future expansion is likely to involve the addition of a second tier to the South Stand, which would raise the capacity to over 90,000. The stadium's record attendance was recorded in 1939, when 76,962 spectators watched the FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town.\r\n\r\nOld Trafford has hosted FA Cup semi-finals, England fixtures, matches at the 1966 World Cup and Euro 96 and the 2003 Champions League Final, as well as rugby league's annual Super League Grand Final and the final of two Rugby League World Cups.

Formed in 1876, they have played at the Riverside Stadium since August 1995, their third ground since turning professional in 1889. Their longest-serving home was Ayresome Park, where they played for 92 years, from 1903 to 1995.\r\n\r\nThey were one of the founding members of the Premier League in 1992. The club's main rivals are Sunderland and Newcastle United, however the club also takes part in Yorkshire derbies with several other Yorkshire clubs; most notably Leeds United.\r\n\r\nThe club's highest league finish to date was third in the 1913\u201314 season and they have only spent two seasons outside of the Football League's top two divisions. The club came close to folding in 1986 after experiencing severe financial difficulties before the club was saved by a consortium led by then board member and later chairman Steve Gibson. Middlesbrough were controversially deducted three points for failing to fulfil a fixture against Blackburn Rovers during the 1996\u201397 Premier League season and were subsequently relegated. They were promoted the following season and spent eleven consecutive seasons in the top division before relegation. Middlesbrough won the League Cup in 2004, the club's first and only major trophy. They reached the 2006 UEFA Cup Final in May 2006 but were beaten by Spanish side Sevilla. On 24 May 2009, Middlesbrough were relegated to the Championship, failing to extend their 11-year stay in the Premier League.\r\n\r\nThe club's traditional kit is red with white detailing. The various crests throughout the club's history, the most recent of which was adopted in May 2007, incorporate a lion rampant.",

Its current capacity is 34,742 all seated, although there is provisional planning permission in place to expand that to 42,000 if required.\r\n\r\nThe stadium was built to replace Ayresome Park after the Taylor Report, which required all top division football stadia to be all-seater. After the report was delivered in January 1990, Middlesbrough needed an all-seater stadium by August 1994, and were unable to expand Ayresome Park outwards owing to its location in a residential area, and expanding the stadium upwards would have limited the club to a capacity of around 20,000 seats \u2013 the club wanted a considerably larger capacity. The decision was taken by club officials to build a new stadium; Teesside Development Corporation offered them the Middlehaven site by the River Tees for development.\r\n\r\nThe new 30,000 seater stadium was constructed by Taylor Woodrow Construction for \u00a316 million, taking 32 weeks to complete after work began in the autumn of 1994. The name of the stadium was chosen by the club's fans, following a vote during the final game at Ayresome Park. The other choices available were Middlehaven Stadium, Erimus Stadium and Teesside Stadium. When first opened, the name was amended to Cellnet Riverside Stadium (and then BT Cellnet Riverside Stadium) as part of a \u00a33 million sponsorship deal with Cellnet, but this deal ended after the 2001\u201302 season.\r\n\r\nThe first game was played against Chelsea in front of a 28,286 crowd (the highest home attendance in 14 years) on 26 August 1995. Middlesbrough won the game 2\u20130, with Craig Hignett taking the honour of scoring the first ever goal at the stadium, Jan \u00c5ge Fj\u00f8rtoft scoring the second. Their first season at their new stadium was also their first back in the FA Premier League following promotion after two seasons away.\r\n\r\nIn their second season at the Riverside Stadium, Middlesbrough were runners-up in both of the domestic cups but a points deduction in the league meant that they were relegated from the Premier League.\r\n\r\nIn 1998 \u2013 when Middlesbrough were promoted back to the Premier League at the first attempt \u2013 the capacity was increased by 5,000 by filling in the north and south-west corners at a cost of \u00a35 million. This expansion gave the stadium its current 35,000 capacity.",

The stadium has a capacity of 32,505 and is currently the largest football stadium in the South of England (excluding London).\r\nSince the 1980s, when Southampton regularly challenged the best sides in the English league (particularly in 1984 when they were league runners-up), there had been talk of the club relocating to a new stadium to replace The Dell due to the old stadium's cramped location which made it unsuitable for major expansion work.\r\n\r\nWhen the Taylor Report on 29 January 1990 required all First and Second Division clubs to have all-seater stadiums by August 1994, Southampton's directors initially decided to upgrade The Dell into an all-seater stadium (which was completed in 1993) but speculation about relocation continued, especially as an all-seater Dell had a capacity of just over 15,000; despite this, Southampton continued to defy the odds and survive in the new FA Premier League after 1992.\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthy and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to build a new 25,000 seater stadium and leisure complex at Stoneham, on the outskirts of Southampton, the city council offered the club the chance to build a new ground on the disused gas work site in the heart of the city, about one and half miles from The Dell.\r\n\r\nThe move was cited as the club returning home, because the club was formed by members of the nearby St. Mary's Church, as the football team of St. Mary's Church Young Men's Association before becoming Southampton St. Mary's F.C., and eventually Southampton F.C.\r\n\r\nConstruction started in December 1999 and was completed at the end of July 2001, with work on the stadium itself and improvements to local infrastructure cost a total of \u00a332 million.\r\n\r\nThe Saints have been in residence since August 2001 when they moved from The Dell, which for the final years of its life, held just over 15,000 spectators \u2013 less than half the size of the new stadium. The first match was played on 1 August 2001 against RCD Espanyol, with the Spanish side winning 4\u20133.\r\n\r\nThe first competitive hat trick at the stadium was scored by Stafford Browne for Aldershot Town in a 3\u20131 victory over Havant & Waterlooville in the Hampshire Senior Cup final on 1 May 2002.",

Swansea City represent England when playing in European competitions, although they have represented Wales in the past. They play their home matches at the Liberty Stadium.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1912 as Swansea Town and joined the Football League in 1921. The club changed their name in 1969, when it adopted the name Swansea City to reflect Swansea's new status as a city.\r\n\r\nIn 1981, the club were promoted to the original Football League First Division. It was during the following season they came close to winning the league title, but a decline then set near the season's end before finishing sixth, although a club record. It was from here the club suffered a relegation the season after, returning to the Football League Fourth Division a few seasons later, then narrowly avoided relegation to the Football Conference in 2003. Prior to playing home matches at the Liberty Stadium, the team had previously hosted at the Vetch Field. The Swansea City Supporters Society Ltd owns 20% of the club, with their involvement hailed by Supporters Direct as \"the most high profile example of the involvement of a supporters' trust in the direct running of a club\". The club's subsequent climb from the fourth division of English football to the top division is chronicled in the 2014 film, Jack to a King \u2013 The Swansea Story.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Swansea were promoted to the English Premier League, becoming the first Welsh team to play in it since its formation in 1992. On 24 February 2013, Swansea beat Bradford City 5\u20130 to win the 2012\u201313 Football League Cup (the competition's highest ever winning margin for the final), winning the first major trophy in the club's history and qualifying for the 2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League, where they reach the Last 32 stage but lost over two legs to SSC Napoli.",

      "strStadiumDescription": "Liberty Stadium (Welsh: Stadiwm Liberty) is a sports stadium and conferencing venue located in the Landore area of Swansea, Wales. The stadium is all-seated. It has a capacity of 20,750, making it the largest purpose-built venue in Swansea. It is the home stadium of Premier League club Swansea City and the Ospreys. As a result of Swansea City's promotion, the stadium became the first Premier League ground in Wales. The Liberty Stadium has the second smallest capacity of the 20 stadia in the Premier League for the 2014/15 season after Loftus Road. It is the third largest stadium in Wales \u2013 after Millennium Stadium and Cardiff City Stadium. In European competition the stadium is known as Swansea Stadium due to advertising rights.\r\nWith the Vetch Field, St Helen's and The Gnoll no longer being up-to-date venues to play at, and both the Swans and the Ospreys not having the necessary capital to invest into a new stadium, Swansea council and a developer-led consortia submitted a proposal for a sustainable 'bowl' venue for 20,520 seats on a site to the west of the River Tawe on the site of the Morfa Stadium, an athletics stadium owned by the City and County of Swansea council. It was funded by a 355,000 ft retail park on land to the east of the river. The final value of the development being in excess of \u00a350m.\r\n\r\nOn 10 July 2005, Liberty Stadium was opened and became the home to Swansea City (replacing the Vetch Field) and the Ospreys (replacing St Helen's and The Gnoll). On 23 July 2005, Liberty Stadium was officially opened as Swansea City faced Fulham, (then managed by former Swansea player Chris Coleman) in an friendly match. The match ended in a 1\u20131 draw with the first goal being scored by Fulham's Steed Malbranque. Swansea's Marc Goodfellow scored during the game to level the match.\r\n\r\nBefore a league match between Swansea City and Oldham Athletic in October 2005, a statue of Ivor Allchurch was unveiled to commemorate the Swansea-born star who during two spells for the club scored a record 164 goals in 445 appearances.\r\n\r\nThe first capacity crowd recorded at Liberty Stadium was on the 1 November 2006 when The Ospreys beat Australia 24\u201316. The stadium has hosted multiple Wales football internationals, listed below.\r\n\r\nSeating at Liberty Stadium is often sold out during Swansea City football matches. Swansea City have expressed a desire to have the capacity of the stadium increased and have held talks with Swansea Council during the 2011/2012 season for the future expansion of the Liberty Stadium which would be completed in a number of phases beginning with expansion or redevelopment of the east stand. Plans for a new McDonald's fast food restaurant to be opened near the stadium threw expansion plans into doubt. However, the planning application was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nIn December 2013, it was reported by BBC News that the European Commission had requested details of the funding of the stadium, as part of a wider inquiry into state aid for sports clubs.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the 2014-15 Premier League season, a number of changes were made to the stadium. These included two new 'Jumbotron' screens inside the north and south stands, measuring approximately 200 inches. Due to sponsorship by LG all televisions in food outlets and concourse were replaced by 50\" LG TV screens and the south stand renamed The LG Stand. New advertising boards with a crowd facing side were also added.",

Its newly developed training ground is in Bulls Cross on the northern borders of the London Borough of Enfield.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1882, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, making it the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League. Tottenham was the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960\u201361 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 it became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition \u2013 the European Cup Winners' Cup. In 1967 it won the FA Cup for a third time in the 1960s. In the 1970s Tottenham won the League Cup on two occasions and was the inaugural winner of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. In the 1980s Spurs won several trophies: the FA Cup twice, FA Community Shield and the UEFA Cup in 1984. In the 1990s the club won the FA Cup and the League Cup. When it won the League Cup once more in 2008, it meant that it had won a major trophy in each of the last six decades \u2013 an achievement only matched by Manchester United.\r\n\r\nThe club's Latin motto is Audere est Facere (lit: \"To Dare Is to Do\"), and its emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football.

Founded in 1881 as Watford Rovers, the club entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1886, and the Southern League a decade later. After finishing the 1914\u201315 season as Southern League champions under the management of Harry Kent, Watford joined the Football League in 1920. The club played at several grounds in its early history, before moving to a permanent location at Vicarage Road in 1922, where it remains to this day. Watford spent most of the following half century in the lower divisions of The Football League, changing colours and crest on multiple occasions.\r\n\r\nEngland manager Graham Taylor saw Watford scale new heights. Between Taylor's appointment in 1977 and departure in 1987, Watford rose from the Fourth Division to the First Division. The team finished second in the First Division in the 1982\u201383 season, competed in the UEFA Cup in 1983\u201384, and also reached the 1984 FA Cup Final. Watford experienced a decade of decline between 1987 and 1997, before Taylor returned as full-time manager, leading the team to successive promotions from the renamed Second Division to the Premier League. The club's most recent stint in the top division of English football was during the 2006\u201307 season, under Aidy Boothroyd's management. In the 2014\u201315 season, Watford will compete in the Football League Championship \u2013 the second highest level of English football.\r\n\r\nWatford is currently owned by the Pozzo family, which also owns Udinese Calcio in Italy and Granada CF in Spain. Sir Elton John, who owned Watford during both of Graham Taylor's successful periods as manager, served alongside Taylor as the club's joint Honorary Life President, until 2008  only to later resume the role which he now shares alongside Graham Taylor.",

In addition to being Watford's home since opening, the stadium was also home to Wealdstone F.C. between 1991 and 1993, and to rugby union side Saracens from 1997 until they moved to their new home at Allianz Park in February 2013.\r\n\r\nAfter purchasing the freehold of the stadium from Benskins in January 2002, Watford's financial situation forced them to sell and lease back the stadium later that year. However, after a campaign entitled 'Let's Buy Back The Vic' with donations coming from fans, as well as celebrity former owner Elton John donating the entire proceeds of a concert held at the venue, the club was able to repurchase the stadium in September 2004.",

It has been the home of Premier League club West Bromwich Albion F.C. since 1900, when it became the sixth ground to be used by the club. The ground was the last Football League ground to be built in the 19th century. At an altitude of 551 feet (168 m), it is the highest ground among those of all 92 Premier League and Football League clubs.\r\nThe expiry of the lease on Stoney Lane, as well as the club's desire for a more spacious location, saw them move once again in 1900, this time permanently. All of Albion's previous grounds had been close to the centre of West Bromwich, but on this occasion they took up an \"out of town\" site on the borders of Handsworth. The area was covered in hawthorn bushes, which were cleared to make way for the new ground, hence its name, the Hawthorns. The club signed a lease for the land on 14 May 1900, giving them the option to buy within 14 years from the owner, Sandwell Park Colliery, and Albion did indeed buy the freehold on the ground in June 1913.\r\n\r\nWhen opened, the Hawthorns could hold around 35,500 spectators. The first match took place on Monday 3 September 1900, when Albion drew 1\u20131 with Derby County in front of a crowd of 20,104. Derby's England international Steve Bloomer scored the first Hawthorns goal, with Chippy Simmons equalizing for Albion. The first Saturday game followed soon after, with Albion losing out 0\u20131 to fierce local rivals Aston Villa in front of a capacity crowd, officially put at 35,417 but with many more forcing entry and an estimated 15,000 people locked out. The 1900\u201301 campaign was not a successful one however, as Albion finished bottom of the table and were relegated to Division Two. Their defeat to Sheffield United on the final day of the season was witnessed by just 1,050 spectators, which remains the record lowest crowd for a league game at the Hawthorns.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "West Ham United Football Club is an English professional football club based in Upton Park, East London, England currently playing in the Premier League, England's top tier of football. The club was founded in 1895 as Thames Ironworks and reformed in 1900 as West Ham United. In 1904 the club relocated to their current Boleyn Ground stadium. They initially competed in the Southern League and Western League before eventually joining the full Football League in 1919 and subsequently enjoyed promotion to the top flight for the 1923 season. 1923 also saw the club feature in the first FA Cup Final to be held at Wembley against Bolton Wanderers.\r\n\r\nIn 1940 the team won the inaugural Football League War Cup. The club has won the FA Cup three times: in 1964, 1975 and 1980 as well as being runners-up twice, in 1923 and 2006. In 1965, they won the European Cup Winners Cup, and in 1999 they won the Intertoto Cup. They are one of eight existent clubs never to have fallen below the second tier of English football, spending 55 of 87 league seasons in Division 1 to 2013. However, unlike the other seven (Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur), the club has never won the league title. The club's best final league position is third place in the 1985\u201386 First Division.\r\n\r\nThree West Ham players played significant roles in England's victory in the 1966 World Cup final; captain Bobby Moore, and both goalscorers, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters.",
